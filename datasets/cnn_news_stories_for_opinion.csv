" there was a stretch in which date night was the only time i'd make a move -- which wouldn't be terrible if it weren't already established the week before that i was going to get lucky that night, anyway. it was like turning on the television and being surprised to see that american idol was on at the same time and channel it was last week. that's not getting lucky; that's just tuning in for your regularly scheduled program. date night had turned sex into a regularly scheduled program. not to mention it put all of this pressure on us to have sex, because what would it mean if we didn't? we no longer were attracted to each other? he's cheating on me? my breath stinks? it's the date night catch-22: bored if you do, mortified if you don't. no, for us, it had to go. i know, i know, relationships are more than just sex, and date nights allow parents the time to talk and not be interrupted by the needs of their children. i get it and totally agree. but i would add that if you routinely find yourself not thinking about having sex with the person you're out date-nighting with, then perhaps it's more than the kids' busy schedule that's keeping you two apart. no one goes out on a first date hoping only to run errands in the future. this is just one of the many reasons why i believe that people who argue against marriage equality have few, if any, gay couples in their lives. if they had some gay couples as friends, then they'd know that we aren't having sex, just like them, and we aren't that big a deal. in fact, if conservative politicians were really interested in protecting marriage, they'd ban date night; it's a much bigger threat. i'm being silly, of course. but it is amazing to me how so many of the highs and lows of couples' relationships really are the same -- regardless of the people involved. i told a friend i was considering writing this column, and he joked that he didn't believe his wife even bothered brushing her teeth until date night. we're so busy with the kids, he said. who has time for sex? can you string together five words more sad than who has time for sex? and yet, that's where so many of us are, right? strapped for cash, pressed for time and looking for love. this year, the u.s. bureau of labor statistics reported that in married couple households with children under 18, both parents worked in 58 percent of them. that, together with the fact that kids are far busier with scheduled activities today than a generation ago, it's little wonder why, in a recent poll, a third of those polled said they would give up sex for a week rather than give up their smartphone for a week. i guess they've figured they've already given up sex, but if they lose their smartphones, they won't know what time to pick their kids up. but notice i said they and not we. i'm not giving up sex for a smartphone or anything else, which is why when the school year starts, date night is not going on the calendar. i didn't share all of this because i'm unhappy in my relationship but rather because i am happy in my relationship. i want to be with my partner for the rest of my life, so i'm resisting any construct that could undermine the most essential element for any long term couple: passion. life is busy, and if you're married with children, it can feel like a complete rat race. but i'm ok with the race as long as chasing the person i love is part of it. for me, date nights are great in theory, but the romantic chase in the midst of life's chaos is what i prefer. i know that's not for everyone, but neither are handcuffs. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of lz granderson.

" editor's note: barbara ehrenreich's book nickel and dimed: on (not) getting by in america (macmillan) has just been released in a 10th-anniversary edition with a new afterword by the author. (cnn) -- everyone to the left of michele bachmann seems to agree that america's most immediate problem isn't the budget deficit, but the jobs deficit. fourteen million americans are unemployed, and the number ranges up to almost 16 million if you include those who want full-time jobs but can only find part-time ones. put all those people to work, and they will cheerfully run out to the malls and spend, thus reigniting the engine of consumer capitalism. or so the conventional wisdom goes. but just how many jobs will the economy have to generate to cure the jobs deficit -- 14 million? sixteen million? or a whole lot more? the answer depends not just on the number of people out of work but on the quality of jobs being offered. according to a january report from the national employment law project, 76% of the new jobs generated in 2010 were of the low-paying variety, offering between $9 to $15 an hour. some people can get by quite handily on $9 or so an hour -- especially if they're willing to live outdoors or on a friend's couch -- but, generally speaking, the less jobs pay, the more of them you're going to need to get. suppose you're a parking lot attendant, a dishwasher or an office cleaner, and you earn only the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. if you have two children to support, your annual earnings will be $3,000 below the official poverty level for a family of three, so you'll need at least a part-time second job. not to mention the fact that you'll need to designate one of your children as a full-time baby sitter for the other. having worked in several low-paid jobs myself, i get a little nervous when people start throwing around the word jobs unmodified by adjectives such as decent-paying or good. what kind of jobs are we talking about? are we talking about jobs with union-style wages and benefits or big-box mcjobs that come with the assumption that you'll qualify for food stamps? between 1998 and 2000, while doing research for my book nickel and dimed: on (not) getting by in america, i worked as a waitress, a maid with a cleaning service, a nursing home aide and a walmart associate, with my pay averaging $7 an hour, or the equivalent of about $9 an hour in today's dollars. even when i managed to line up my schedule so i could work two jobs at a time, discretionary spending wasn't on the agenda -- not after gas, food and rent for a half-size trailer or a room in a shabby residential motel. fortunately, jobs were easy to find at the time, and the soaring dot-com economy wasn't depending on me. i know the argument: the more jobs there are, even low-paying, the more power workers have to demand higher wages, so wages will automatically rise. but in the late '90s, while employers were experiencing a labor shortage, hourly wages rose only slightly -- not because the law of supply and demand had been suspended, but because employers had become fiendishly efficient at preventing workers from organizing to demand higher wages. today, with the very concept of collective bargaining under political attack from the right, the chance that more jobs will mean better jobs has grown even slimmer. president barack obama promised -- just three years ago when he was in general a more promising sort of fellow -- that he would raise the federal minimum wage to $9.50 by 2011. maybe he forgot, just as he forgot his promise to press for the employee free choice act, which would have made it easier for workers to organize. or maybe he was intimidated by unemployment rates in excess of 9% and accepted the defeatist notion that any job -- no matter how low-paid, backbreaking or abusive -- is better than none. that's been the sad trajectory of the american middle-class spirit from the late '70s to the present day: we've gone from johnny paycheck's take this job and shove it to begging the sleek-suited job creators for whatever they can throw our way. fortunately there are some courageous exceptions to this idea. forty-five thousand verizon employees are walking picket lines to defend their hard-won union wages and benefits. thousands of walmart employees have signed up as members of an association ( our walmart ) to demand respect from the company. even the most isolated and invisible workers -- nannies and maids -- are organizing themselves into a national domestic workers alliance. as anyone in these groups could you tell: we don't just need more jobs, we need more jobs that treat employees like humans and pay what you could actually live on. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of barbara ehrenreich.

" the favorable tax treatment of employer-paid health insurance generates overconsumption of health care and contributes to rising health care costs. the benefits go mainly to middle- and upper-income households, since those without jobs get no employer-provided benefits. numerous loopholes for favored industries in the corporate tax code distort the market's investment decisions and reward the well-funded and politically connected. and it is not just the tax code that harms the economy while favoring the better off. excessive licensing requirements, permitting fees, restrictive examinations and other barriers to entry into medicine, law, plumbing, hair styling and many other professions are bad for economic productivity because they artificially restrict the supply of these services. and these barriers redistribute income perversely by raising incomes for those protected and raising prices for everyone. crony capitalism -- the special treatment of favored industries like autos -- runs counter to economic efficiency because it protects businesses that would otherwise fail, and it maintains high incomes for executives and shareholders. the too-big-to-fail doctrine, exhibited most recently in the tarp bailout of wall street banks, distorts efficiency by encouraging excess risk-taking. meanwhile, bailouts generate huge incomes for the lucky few who keep gains in good times and pass losses to taxpayers in bad times. in contrast to these and other policies, the one buffett criticizes -- low tax rates on capital income -- is beneficial for the economy, including lower-income households. economists agree broadly that an efficient tax system should avoid taxing income, dividends and capital gains to promote savings, investment and growth. tax rates on capital income should therefore be low or even zero. the u.s. is far from this ideal, especially given the high tax rate on corporate income and the additional taxation at the personal level. buffet asserts that taxing capital income has never deterred anyone from investing. well, then he has never discussed the issue with me or many of my friends. more importantly, taxing investment returns plays a huge role in what kinds of investments occur, and where, even if it has minor effects on the amounts. these tax-induced distortions in investment choices then reduce economic growth. high u.s. taxation on capital income drives investment overseas. so raising capital tax rates will not make the super-rich pay their fair share; it will encourage capital flight, driving factories and innovation abroad. the rich will still get their high returns, but u.s. workers will have fewer jobs and lower wages. buffett errs, most fundamentally, by focusing on outcomes rather than policies. the right question is which policies promote differences in incomes that reflect hard work, energy, innovation and creativity, rather than reward the unethical, the politically connected and the tax-savvy. in economics, as in sports, we should adopt good rules and insist that everyone play by them. then we should stand back and applaud the winners. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of jeffrey miron.

" in my state of michigan, we have districts where less than 10% of the students tested were deemed proficient in math. in the city where i live, less than 45% of the students passed reading . what do we think is going to happen to our economy as the jobs of tomorrow become more technical and a large chunk of our work force can barely read? i have one idea -- detroit. the national institute for literacy found that nearly 47% of the motor city's adults are functionally illiterate. not surprisingly, detroit's unemployment is near 12%, and the city is the country's poorest metropolis according to the census. and this correlation between academic achievement and poverty can be seen nationwide. four of our poorest states had four of the lowest act composite scores -- mississippi, tennessee, kentucky and arkansas. conversely four of our richest states had four of the highest test results -- massachusetts, connecticut, new hampshire and new jersey. programs such as no child left behind started in a good place but when school funding, bonuses and jobs hinge on scores, of course there's going to be a temptation to cheat. president barack obama's race to the top tried to address some of nclb's problems but its success is tripped up by the poverty line as well. in may obama gave the commencement speech at rttt winner booker t. washington high school in memphis, tennessee. two months later, the city's school board voted to delay starting school indefinitely because it didn't have enough money to open doors. memphis, like detroit , is one of our poorest cities. and this is not just an inner-city problem; not when 80% of the country is sharing less than 20% of the wealth. the less money people are making, the less tax revenue that's available to help fund schools. what we need is an aggressive, multipronged strategy geared toward closing the education gap between the rich and everyone else because everyone else -- in the spirit of the wall street bailouts -- is too big to fail. instead of dangling federal dollars like a carrot that some disadvantaged educators feel they must falsify test scores to obtain, how about the education department uses that money to work with some of the wall street companies we bailed out to establish paid internships for promising high school students? it would be better to use money from the education department to subsidize a tax break for professionals in careers such as engineering who tutor a certain number of hours a school year. when u.s. basketball won bronze in 1988, you would've thought the world used the american flag to wipe mud off its shoe by the way we responded. yet our education system continues to slip in the world ranking, and i don't see a teachers-of-the year dream team or a super committee made of top business leaders to help address this very real crisis. when the world was less competitive, we could afford to let the rich send their kids to private school and allow the rest of us to scramble the best we could. but technology has made the world smaller and college admission and job hiring is more cutthroat. today the education of our youth is no longer somebody else's problem -- because kids who lag behind grow into adults and a work force that lags behind. and an inferior work force competing against the best in the world is everybody's problem. so if less than gold wasn't acceptable for us in basketball, why do we continue to accept less than bronze with our kids' education? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of lz granderson.

" in iraq, much the same is true of nuri al-maliki and the iraqi government. most recently, maliki coddled the syrian regime in the midst of its crackdown and, for the past few years, has moved ever closer to iran and mahmoud ahmadinejad. meanwhile, the iraqi constitution also states, no law may be enacted that contradicts the established provisions of islam. in egypt, we helped push hosni mubarak out of office, and today it appears the muslim brotherhood is likely to gain a large number of seats in parliament this fall , while the new egypt has already restored relations with iran and helped broker a hamas-plo alliance. so what will come next in libya? it is a sign of our failed intelligence operations that we do not have a good grasp of who and what constitutes the opposition there. but there is credible evidence that true democrats constitute only a minority of the opposition. additionally, the drafted constitution for the new libya states that islam will be the religion of the state and the principal source of legislation is islamic jurisprudence (sharia). one early test of the new libya will be the disposition of abdel basset ali megrahi, the libyan terrorist responsible for blowing up pan am flight 103, and whether he will be extradited to the united kingdom or the united states. he was freed from prison in the uk two years ago and has been living freely in libya ever since. but the true test of all the uprisings we have seen this year, from egypt to syria to libya, is not exclusively about what happens in those countries but whether the united states will finally get morally serious about promulgating a consistent foreign policy toward them. right now, there is no plausible explanation as to why we would push mubarak out, while we held our counsel during iran's uprising. there is no plausible explanation as to why we would activate nato against libya, while we coddled syria for so long (including sending an ambassador to damascus and saying positive things about the assad regime.) not all of our mistakes are president obama's doing. it is worth recalling that while americans have universally heralded the end of the gadhafi regime based on his reign of terror and brutality, it was president bush who restored diplomatic relations with libya and took it off the state sponsors of terrorism list. but, just now, as we cheer what looks like the mad dog's fall, let us recall, as shakespeare put it: the worst is not, so long as we can say 'this is the worst.' that is sadly, likely, the case in egypt. let us retool and rethink so such will not happen again elsewhere. it is long past time for a moral consistency, it is long past time for a better intelligence apparatus throughout the middle east where the cia needs to lift its game, and it is long past time we instruct our putative and potential allies in the virtues and principles of the kinds of revolutions that do not devour their own children. that starts with, but does not end with, one of the most esteemed precepts of our nation's own founding -- the separation of church and state. a revolutionary regime basing its law on the precepts of islam, or a country where the muslim brotherhood is poised to take more and more power, is simply not what we should be promoting. nor are such organizations of power in the interest of the oppressed, who truly do want genuine freedom. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of william bennett.

" the effects of plate tectonics are felt much more strongly in regions that are close to plate boundaries, such as california or japan, but the east coast of the united states can experience smaller events, situated as it is essentially in the middle of a tectonic plate -- the north american plate. the ice sheet/glacier explanation is perhaps slightly more widely accepted, but in either case we are talking about very small motions of the earth that result in relatively rare earthquakes. in fact, these earthquakes on the east coast occur so rarely that it is very difficult for earth scientists to identify specific faults that are active, that is, ones where over time we would expect significant earthquakes to occur. if we were able to go back in time and record earthquakes in this region over many thousands of years, we would probably see that some areas had fairly regular earthquake activity, and we could then come up with a more solid explanation. in fact, that is what many people in the scientific community are trying to do -- they can't go and get the sorts of records that we receive from seismic instruments today, but they can go look for evidence of shaking in the past that tells us that there was a large earthquake in a specific region at a particular time. this is called paleoseismology and is a very powerful tool when combined with observations of current earthquakes. cnn: i thought earthquakes were a west coast phenomenon. aren't these relatively rare here? lohman: yes, they are rarer but result in relatively higher levels of shaking. the west coast is a much more active region, with earthquakes, volcanoes and high rates of deformation overall and with a relatively warm, squishy young crust compared with the old, cold rock material underneath the east coast. this means that the seismic waves that radiate outward from an earthquake in california are absorbed much more and are not felt as strongly as they would be for a similar earthquake here on the east coast. scientists often say that the east coast rings like a bell after an earthquake, with the seismic waves remaining strong over long distances, whereas in california the seismic waves are absorbed relatively quickly, so their effect is more like the thud you'd hear if you rang a wooden bell. cnn: what's the risk for tsunami? lohman: there does not appear to be a risk for a tsunami from this earthquake at this particular time. one potential source would be if the shaking caused an offshore landslide -- and there is no evidence of that here. if the conditions are right, landslides can cause quite damaging tsunamis. this primarily depends on how large the landslide is and how quickly it moves. if the landslide moves slowly, then it doesn't transmit a lot of energy to the water, and we don't get a significant tsunami. cnn: is the magnitude 5.2 earthquake that struck colorado on monday night related to this quake? lohman: there isn't any indication of that right now, but that is certainly something people will look at. cnn: when was the last time we had an earthquake on this side of the country? what happened? lohman: there have been quite a few large earthquakes on the east coast, although since many of them occurred before we had the types of modern seismic instrumentation that we have today, it is difficult to determine their exact size. there was one in 1897 very close to the location of today's event, in western virginia, and there have been large earthquakes near boston, charleston (south carolina) and other cities several times a century in the past that caused damage to churches, chimneys and other tall structures at the time. much smaller events, of the order magnitude 3 to 4, occur many times a year on the east coast, but are usually only felt by the people who are directly on top of them. for reference, a magnitude 4 is about 33 times smaller than a magnitude 5, and 1,000 times smaller than a magnitude 6. cnn: what's the risk for structures here? like high-rises, nuclear power plants, reservoirs, water and transportation systems? lohman: when engineers discuss risk and hazard from earthquakes, they tend to need to know quantities that are quite difficult for earth scientists to provide. earth scientists try to convert our understanding of how frequent earthquakes are likely to occur on a particular fault into numbers that reflect, for example, how likely it is that a particular spot will experience a given amount of shaking within the next 50 years. these are shown as probability of exceedance maps that allow structural engineers to determine the appropriate building codes that should be used for public structures, as well as private ones, in an area. since we have less information about earthquakes on the east coast (since they don't occur as often), we've had to incorporate that uncertainty into our estimates. so the seismic hazard maps you can find online through the united states geological survey hazards program reflect our understanding about all the faults we know about as well as an attempt to account for the ones we aren't aware of. cnn: is the east coast ready for an earthquake? lohman: that's a question for a different kind of scientist or engineer. from what i saw today, the public response appeared to be very well-coordinated and appropriate. sensitive facilities were shut down for further inspection, and agencies such as the usgs got information out to the public very rapidly. this is a very good time for people to think about their own preparedness for any natural disaster, however. it's a good time to go through your house and make sure that your bookcases are attached to the walls (which is a good thing to do anyway) and that you have some emergency supplies and water on hand.

" reagan, the former actor, was perfect for a time when politics was more scripted. even in a supposed unscripted debate, he could prepare and perfectly deliver a line like, there you go again. palin must compete at a time when coverage is more constant and less formal. she has wisely, for example, taken to facebook and twitter, confident the press will pick up whatever she writes. what is most reaganesque about sarah palin, however, is that on camera, her optimism about america appears natural. this is a quality that should not be underestimated, since it allows her the leeway to be negative without turning off voters by appearing mean-spirited. this offers at least the possibility that, despite her current low standing in the polls, she will be able to leap-frog over the more negative sounding bachmann and perry, and compete head-to-head with romney. even more than they did in 2008, americans want hope. what palin's handlers have in the former governor is a candidate they can cast in a pitch-perfect media campaign that blends a criticism of the obama administration with a positive message about the future. i am not saying palin will be the president someday, or will even secure the republican nomination. if the voting in either contest were held today, she would lose. it is very dangerous, however, to count out a candidate like palin before she has had a chance to campaign. recall that, back in january 1980, before he had even secured the republican nomination, an abc news poll had reagan trailing carter by 30 points. at the very end of the palin video, there is a shot of a bear rising up on its hind legs. the camera angle, a somewhat silhouetted view looking up a hill, is right out of another 1984 reagan commercial, the so-called bear in the woods spot. in the reagan ad, the bear stood for the former soviet union. now, the not-so-subtle reference is to the momma grizzly from alaska. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of paul sracic.

" each time we run it, we feed it a slightly different but equally plausible estimate of the current state of the atmosphere, given that our observations are few, far between and imperfect. in each case, we get a different answer; the differences are typically small to begin with but can grow rapidly so that by a week or so, the difference between any two forecasts is as great as the difference between any two arbitrary states of the weather at that time of year. no point in going any further! but we observe that sometimes and in some places, the differences grow slowly, while at other times and places, they may grow much more rapidly. and by using different computer models, we can take into account our imperfect understanding of the physics of the atmosphere. by these means, we can state with some accuracy how confident we are in any particular forecast for any particular time and place. today, one of the greatest challenges faced by weather forecasters is how best to convey their estimates of forecast confidence to the public. ideally, we would like to be able to say with full scientific backing something like the odds of hurricane force winds in new york city sometime between friday and sunday are 20%. we have far to go to perfect these, but probabilistic statements like this are the best for which we can hope. we know from experience that everyone will deal with such probabilistic forecasts in their own way: people have a very broad range of risk aversion. but the next time you are inclined to criticize weather forecasters for assigning probabilities to their forecasts, remember this essay and consider how much better off you are than with other types of forecasters you rely on. your stockbroker, for example. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of kerry emanuel.

" ten years ago, if you had told knowledgeable global observers that hosni mubarak and moammar gadhafi would be toppled from their dictatorial perches within the same year, they probably would have chuckled in your face. but this democracy renaissance across the middle east and north africa became possible only through the grass-roots, democratic mobilization that we have seen on the streets of tunis, cairo and tripoli over the last few months. with neighboring countries like yemen, bahrain and syria in the midst of similar pro-democracy uprisings, the possible falling of each dictatorial domino within the region should give much hope to the men and women of the middle east who yearn for a brighter future for their daughters and granddaughters. with their own berlin wall moments, young people across religious, sectarian and ethnic lines are helping to build their undemocratic arab nations into societies that forgo the dictatorial treachery of the past for the hopeful politics of the future. thomas jefferson once said: i hope our wisdom will grow with our power, and teach us, that the less we use our power, the greater it will be. let us pray that, in a region of the world fraught with cults of megalomaniacal personalities who have spent the better part of the last 50 years oppressing, torturing and marginalizing their own people, pro-democracy movements will inspire people to keep up their efforts to bring political change to syria, yemen and bahrain. this arab spring could turn into an arab year that the whole world can celebrate together. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of arsalan iftikhar.

" jobs had the same vision and ambition -- to bring technology to the masses -- in every year that followed. in 1984, the macintosh ( mac ) first made graphical computing accessible and kicked off the cult of mac. jobs' sway on technological products has become near universal. they are no longer niche products. like the telephone or the automobile, we all use computers -- for work, for play, to create and to communicate. his influence is likely to become even greater. the iphone and ipad are setting the stage for a new generation of truly personal mobile computers. it's not hard to imagine that one day everyone will have one (or at least a cheap knockoff). as with the pcs that came before them, these products are showing the rest of the industry how it's done. they are easy and intuitive to use. they have a delightful magic. and all this comes from a hippie kid who had the ambition to put a dent in the universe and the vision that technology had to be easy enough for even kids to use. look around. jobs' products have become universal, like the automobile or the telephone. he's the most important innovator of our times, and his resignation is a great loss. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of leander kahney.

" work permit immigration plan raises false hopes by ruben navarrette jr ., cnn contributor story highlights ruben navarrette: obama's plan to issue work permits to some facing deportation is confusing it's meant to help the worthy and get criminals out, but details are hard to come by, he says progressives think it means reprieves; conservatives call it a back-door amnesty, he writes navarrette: policy tries to be tough and compassionate at the same time but won't do much editor's note: ruben navarrette jr. writes a weekly column for cnn.com and is a nationally syndicated columnist. san diego (cnn) -- how cruel can the obama administration be to illegal immigrants, as well as to their families and supporters? this cruel: for the sake of politics, it offers false hope to the desperate. it takes a meager offering and a minor tweaking of immigration policy, dresses it up with bows and ribbons and bills it as part of a grand 21st century immigration system. but because the administration can't be pinned down on specifics as to how the new policy will work, no one can tell whether this is one step forward -- or two steps back. and how desperate are many illegal immigrants in the united states to get a simple work permit -- not citizenship mind you, just a slip of paper allowing them to pick avocados, milk cows, clean horse stalls, clean windows atop skyscrapers, slaughter cattle or do any other dirty and dangerous job that most americans won't do for any amount of money? this desperate: having heard that the obama administration would suspend deportations and issue work permits for some facing deportation, some illegal immigrants are reportedly thinking of turning themselves in to immigration officials so they can work legally in the united states. the bizarre revelation comes courtesy of univision anchor jorge ramos who -- along with producers of the network's sunday morning talk show al punto -- did a phenomenal job of separating myth from reality in discussing the new changes in the administration's immigration policy. ramos told viewers that he had received, via twitter, many inquiries asking whether the undocumented should allow themselves to get arrested so they could have a shot at getting a work permit. look, i'm the son of a retired cop who spent 37 years on the job and someone who supports deporting illegal immigrants as long as we don't outsource immigration enforcement to local police and handle the process according to the rules. so i could make the argument that illegal immigrants should turn themselves in to law enforcement, or for that matter go home on their own, because it's the right thing to do. but they shouldn't do it because they expect to get something in return from the obama administration. in trying to be both tough and compassionate, team obama has made complete hash of its immigration policy. one minute, obama is insisting that he supports comprehensive immigration reform; the next, he is doubling down on the failed strategy of enforcement only. last week, it was announced that the department of homeland security would review about 300,000 deportation cases in the pipeline to see whether any of those individuals should stay here and be given a work permit. it'll be done on a case-by-case basis, and the administration hasn't provided any details on how it will work. officials will say that the groups most likely to benefit are military veterans, their spouses and so-called dreamers -- college students who might have been eligible for legal status under the dream act if five senate democrats hadn't scuttled the bill in december. the administration claims to be exercising prosecutorial discretion and focusing resources on the removal of criminals who -- after committing the civil infraction of violating immigration laws -- graduated to committing actual crimes such as robbery, rape, assault or other serious offenses. and yet, in march, during a town hall meeting for the spanish-language television network univision, obama insisted that deportations of noncriminals were down and that he wanted young people who are undocumented but doing all the right things to succeed. he also said that despite calls for him to use his executive power to exempt certain groups from deportation, including college students, he could do no such thing because it would not conform with my appropriate role as president. so basically, the obama administration is doing what the president claimed that branch of government didn't have the power to do and stopping the deportation of people who he implied were never really in much danger of being deported in the first place. then the extremists in both camps get hold of an issue like this, and they twist the facts even more to advance their agendas. the left hopes for the best and assume that the administration was ending all deportations and handing out millions of reprieves. the right fears the worst and jumps to the conclusion that the administration was handing out mass deportation waivers and pushing through a silent amnesty. calm down, folks. neither scenario is true. some people are likely to benefit from the new rules. in fact, some already have. but, the number of beneficiaries isn't going to be very big. two reasons: first, at least for now, the only people who are eligible for this special dispensation are the 300,000 people in federal custody; the changes don't apply to anyone who might be apprehended in the future. second, if you're in custody but you're not a member of one of three groups -- a dreamer, a military veteran or the spouse of a veteran -- chances are you're not going anywhere. except to your country of origin. nothing wrong with that. these people are here illegally, and deportation is often the appropriate punishment. however, there is something wrong with an administration that by refusing to give details on its new policy raises false hopes and plays with people's lives. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of ruben navarrette jr.

" just the way people who live in the eastern united states prepare for hurricanes, storms and terrorist attacks, the region needs to become earthquake-ready. this could save their lives at home, in another part of the country or the world. in 2004, tilly smith, a 10-year-old girl from england vacationing in indonesia, saved countless lives because she had learned in school about tsunamis, recognized the natural warning signs and, with her mother, guided people to safety. earthquake and tsunami education and preparedness is important for all, everywhere. just as individuals need to prepare, local, state and federal government officials need to perform earthquake hazard assessments to determine and enforce building codes and take other measures to protect lives and property. as we saw on tuesday, earthquakes can and will strike at any moment. we can't afford to let their infrequency lull us into inaction. this earthquake was a wake-up call. the opinions in this commentary are solely those of christa von hillebrandt-andrade.

" it was effective because it was collaborative. the united states used diplomacy, working with its allies at the united nations to pass u.n. resolution 1973, which provided international consensus for the u.s. role. further support came from the arab league, which endorsed the effort to protect libyan civilians. instead of bearing the cost of the conflict, the united states smartly assumed an early leadership role and then transferred responsibilities to our nato partners. multilateralism proved effective once again. it was wise to limit the size and scope of u.s. involvement. u.n. resolution 1973 prohibited the use of ground forces, which minimized mission creep. the libyans wanted limited air support and supplies, not an international ground war. we were a cooperative partner within an important arab and muslim country. the united states showed the benefit of a foreign policy that supports national movements working for democracy. we cannot impose change, but we can bolster emerging efforts for positive reform. the success of the revolution belongs to the libyan people. while nato performed admirably, it was the libyan people who fought, died and freed their country of gadhafi. regular people -- mechanics, doctors, street vendors -- joined the fight, sacrificing everything for the promise of a better country. we should continue to play a supportive role, but it is up to libyans to build their future. the end of gadhafi's dictatorship gives fresh momentum to the arab spring, which has become more uncertain since the revolutions in tunisia and egypt. gadhafi's exit is an essential prelude to the democratic transition we all hope to see in libya. this is the beginning of that transition, not the end. just as the united states supported gaddafi's ouster, it must also support libya as it begins to lay the foundations of democracy. finally, the events in libya should remind us of obama's speech in cairo in june 2009, where he framed a new vision of the u.s. role in the middle east. some members of congress have been critiquing the president on libya, but he provided an effective foreign policy framework that should be continued. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of keith ellison.

" almost is an important characterization because, in fact, historically, the most recent hurricanes hitting the east coast -- hugo (1989) and fran (1996) for example -- have been urban renewal projects. small beach cottages, destroyed or damaged, are replaced by larger buildings and sometimes even high rises. and the new buildings are placed on property that is now more susceptible to storms than before because the shoreline is closer and the dunes are gone. recognizing the futility (and stupidity) of rebuilding in very dangerous places, the states of north carolina and south carolina both instituted policies of not allowing buildings in beach communities to be replaced if destroyed by storms. property owners went to court, important people were offended, politicians got into the mix and the approach did not work in either state. when will we ever learn as the song goes. why spend federal and state money to bring back roads, water and sewer lines, bridges and beaches in locations where we know for certain that storms occurred in the past and will soon occur again in the future; storms that will destroy the communities. how long will it take the public to learn that beachfront construction is a fool's act and that we should not be responsible for such foolish acts. ironically, although the affected beachfront property owners may lack common sense, they do not lack for money and influence, which of course is one reason that we repeatedly bail them out. after hurricane irene the time may come to take a deep breath and in this era of tight budgets, ask why are we bailing these people out once again? those who study global change argue that more intense storms are on the way along with a rising sea level. no better time than now to come to our senses. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of orrin h. pilkey.
