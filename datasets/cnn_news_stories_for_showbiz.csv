" samantha eng writes for socialite life , a sister site of celebuzz . (cnn) -- mtv has long since moved away from being a music channel. just as video killed the radio star marked the ending of an era when mtv played its first music video on august 1, 1981 at 12:01 a.m., 30 years later, the success of the network's shows like the jersey shore have all but eclipsed the video star. so what's a musician striving to connect with fans and sell records to do? if you are lucky, you land an appearance on the video music awards. this sunday mtv will air the 2011 video music awards (aka the vmas) live, marking 27 years of a successful annual award show. last year's vmas boasted the highest ratings since 2002, bringing in 11.4 million viewers and making it the no. 1 cable telecast of 2010 for the mtv network. for musicians, the coveted spot has now become the performance slots during the award show. those selected have been identified as key players within the industry and to be asked has become an honor and acknowledgment of the music that an artist has put out that year. the musicians and mtv look to secure their audience base not through music videos, but by broadening the guest list, in particular the red carpet, to encompass all those within the mtv lineup from musicians, actors/actresses, celebrities and the reality stars that are the driving force of the network. so don't be surprised when the newest teen mom is standing next to the boys from the buried life on this year's pink carpet. that's because the true bread and butter of the network now is its reality shows. mtv's mega-hit, the jersey shore, has successfully followed eight dark haired and tan strangers -- nicole snooki polizzi, mike the situation sorrentino, jenni jwoww farley, paul pauly d delvecchio, ronnie ortiz-magro, sammi sweetheart giancola, and deena nicole cortese (replacing angelina pivarnick in season three) from the new jersey shores to most recently, florence, italy. the premiere episode of season four, following the cast overseas, broke the record for the largest audience for an mtv premiere with 8.8 million viewers, according to us magazine . now that's a reason to fist pump! in addition to the jersey shore, mtv currently has 10 reality shows in rotation. this does not include 11 other reality-based shows ranging from celebrity reality to competitive shows like america's next dance crew. with not much room for 4-minute music videos, mtv launched mtv2, a secondary channel dedicated to constant, commercial-free music videos. however, after two unsuccessful re-launches since its founding, mtv2 struggles to maintain the constant stream of music videos it proclaimed it would be dedicated to. the schedule now focuses the majority of music programming between the hours of 3:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. and has dubbed it amtv2. no wonder mtv decided to drop the music television tag line altogether in 2010 when it launched its official new logo -- though networks executives maintain that music is at the heart of all they do. it just happens to be smothered and covered by reality shows and scripted programming. so where does that leave the vma moon man in the race to the top? while the categories honored at the vmas still include video of the year, best new artist, best video in the hip-hop, pop or rock genres and many others, the award show has become a celebration of the mtv family of programming and of the youth that it entertains. musicians are merely hoping to secure their presence in that market by attending.

" (cnn) -- actor michael showers, who made several appearances in the hbo series treme, was found dead wednesday in louisiana, a port of new orleans official told cnn thursday. his body was spotted floating in the mississippi river near st. louis street in new orleans, said chris bonura, communications director for the port. harbor police responded and retrieved the body, he said. it has been handed over to the coroner for investigation, he added. the coroner's office did not immediately respond to cnn questions about the incident. showers played capt. john guidry on the acclaimed hbo series, which was created by david simon following his cult classic the wire. simon hailed him as a fine actor who contributed his talents to our drama in the warmest and most professional way. we enjoyed his work -- and working with him. going forward, we're going to miss having him as part of our production. all of which seems of little import in light of the loss of a man's whole life, and what that loss truly means to him, his family, his friends. our respect and condolences go to them, especially, simon said in a statement on behalf of the show. hbo is owned by time warner, the parent company of cnn. cnn's rachel wells contributed to this report.

" ( people.com ) -- rose mcgowan's first nine years were anything but traditional. they were spent in the children of god sect, a group that extolled the virtues of free love and prepared for the second coming of jesus. although it proved a harrowing experience -- she fled with her family, she says, once the cult began advocating child-adult sexual relations -- as the setting at first was really idyllic, remembers the actress, 38, who rose to fame on tv's charmed and now stars in conan the barbarian 3d. i grew up in pastoral settings -- specifically, the italian countryside, where her parent were members of the local branch of the children of god. but mcgowan, who was born in florence, knew instinctively that she didn't belong in such a place. i've always been who i am, she says, explaining that while she did believe in god, she wasn't in accord with the hippie lifestyle, and certainly not with their aesthetic or the subservient role of females in the sect. even at her tender age, mcgowan rebelled. i did not want to be like those women. there were basically there to serve the men sexually, she says. prince william kate's bargain date night when her father began to fear that rose might be molested, she says, my dad was strong enough to realize that this hippie love had gone south. she fled the children of god with her father and siblings and moved to the u.s. mcgowan recalls that it was not an easy assimilation into the mainstream way of life. my brothers and sisters, we thought everyone was boring. emma stone is subject of video love letter by jim carrey many years later, she returned to the small town in italy with her then-boyfriend, rocker marilyn manson. we created quite a stir, she admits. looking back at her early experiences, mcgowan deflects with humor some of the dangers and difficulties she faced. in contrast to the dressed-down hippie look of the cult, she says, i came out of the womb waving red lipstick. still, the remembrances left quite an impression. while expressing gratitude to her father, who died in 2008, mcgowan tears up. mostly, though, she realizes the experience is all she ever knew and made her who she is. photos: emma stone's stylish summer looks there are people who will read this story and think i had a strange existence, she says. i think they've had a strange existence! see full article at people.com. 2010 people and time inc. all rights reserved.

" ( people ) -- who's that girl? the model in an old navy ad with a striking resemblance to a particular reality starlet is canadian-born entertainer melissa molinaro, who tells people she's really proud of the commercial despite controversy around it. it was a great shoot and i was honored to be chosen from the auditions which included more than 500 other girls held in different cities, molinaro, 29, says. considerably less enthusiastic is kim kardashian , who has filed a $20 million lawsuit against the clothing chain alleging it made unauthorized use of her name and likeness. molinaro declines to discuss the lawsuit, or reports she stepped out with kardashian's ex, but in an interview with people, it's clear she's more than just a celebrity impostor. here are few things to know: 1. performing is her specialty i started dancing when i was about 3, and have always been a singer, molinaro says, adding that she is currently working on a follow-up to her club-friendly debut single dance floor. 2. she has more ties to kardashian than just appearance although molinaro isn't commenting on the reports, she was rumored to be dating reggie bush. twitpics emerged in june of bush coming out to boa steakhouse in l.a. to help her celebrate her birthday. this followed a number of online reports that the two were getting cozy. 3. she's shared the big screen with paris hilton critics panned it, and imdb lists it as its 18th lowest-ranked movie by users, but the 1994 flick the hillz was paris hilton's big-screen debut, and molinari had a small part in it. in the low-budget flick, she played a girl named ... melissa. 4. her parents inspired her to be career driven my dad put me on skates at the age of two, and i took figure skating, molinaro says of her hockey fan father. i then went on to gymnastics, and finally found my home in dance. my parents were incredibly supportive to help me follow my interests starting with my early childhood. 5. she has an appetite aside from regular girlie-girl hobbies such as going to the movies, shopping and hitting the dance floor, molinaro shamelessly enjoys eating. i love food, she says. i think i am the only girl on twitter who constantly posts pictures of food. see the original article on people.com 2010 people and time inc. all rights reserved.

" (cnn) -- robert e. howard's pulp warrior gets a new face in the form of baywatch and game of thrones graduate jason momoa in the new conan the barbarian. this loud and proudly primitive r-rated movie is definitely not for the squeamish. in the opening sequence, baby conan is carved out of his mortally wounded mother's womb by his father's blade as a battle rages all around them. before he's reached puberty the young whippersnapper is collecting his enemies' heads the way other boys collect baseball cards. for a while there you might think that conan the psychopath would be a more appropriate moniker. to be fair, there's not much point in doing a conan movie if you're going to pull your punches. bear that in mind as our hero shoves his thumb in the gaping hole where one adversary's nose used to be and squeezes, or when he ties another minion to a catapult and sends him flying back to his master, the shadow lord khalar zym ( avatar heavy stephen lang). the sadism is unpleasant, but you get what you pay for. director marcus nispel has a well-earned reputation as a remake specialist with a knack for clobbering the life out of the source material (his versions of the texas chainsaw massacre, pathfinder and friday the 13th are all inferior to the originals). but conan the barbarian has little in common with its namesake, the self-consciously mythic 1982 movie penned by john milius and oliver stone, and taken on its own terms -- as a kind of ultimate fighting dark age fantasy -- it has a certain sledgehammer pragmatism. momoa is at least as competent an actor as arnold schwarzenegger was when he first played the part in the early 1980s, and he looks like he could punch out a horse. but no matter how hard he glowers or how many heads he breaks, he's not half the barbarian arnie was. when schwarzenegger spoke, you had to pick through a dense thicket of umlauts. he was a natural born teuton. momoa has a rich, dark honey of a voice that sounds like swaying palm trees and cool vibes. even when he's shutting down his monk girlfriend's angst-y philosophizing with a curt i live, i love, i slay -- i am content (easily the movie's most memorable line), he can't quite disguise that empathetic laid back jack johnson surfer dude underneath. or maybe it's just the sarong he wears around his waist. in the fashion stakes momoa is easily upstaged by rose mcgowan's valley girl witch, teetering uncertainly on stacked rubber heels in a succession of cut-off i dream of jeannie outfits. she's dressed for the arabian nights, but the film was shot in romania. have they heard of hypothermia in hyboria? mcgowan also gets a freddy kruger-style steel glove and camp-scary hair, enough schlock value to make mincemeat of rachel nichols' woefully blank heroine, despite mcgowan's obvious unease in her gloomy computer-generated surroundings. the story? there isn't much: conan dedicates his life to tracking down the man who turned his father into a lava lamp (and foolishly let the son live). that would be khalar zym, of course, whose lackeys see to it that our barbarian always has his hands full. with its pointless 3-d, a prologue narrated by (who else?) morgan freeman, thudding direction and horrible acting, conan doesn't have a lot going for it -- only sheer bloody-mindedness and another gory battle every three minutes.

" angel laws is the editor in chief and creator of concreteloop.com . august 25 marks the tenth anniversary of the death of singer and actress, aaliyah. (cnn) -- it's been a decade since the tragic death of r b star and budding actress aaliyah dana haughton. just 22 years old at the time of her death, she was in the bahamas heading back to the states after wrapping up her 2001 music video, rock the boat. the twin-engine plane crashed shortly after takeoff. aboard were aaliyah and eight others -- including her hair stylist, eric forman, makeup artists anthony dodd and christopher maldonado, security guard scott gallin, video producer douglas kratz, blackground records employees keith wallace and gina smith, and the pilot, luis morales iii. in an instant their lives and aaliyah's promising career were gone. born in brooklyn and raised in detroit, she quickly garnered a fan base in the early '90s with her original take on r b music. working with industry greats like missy elliott, timbaland, r. kelly and more, she topped the charts with a slew of hits, including back forth, age ain't nothin' but a number, are you that somebody and we need a resolution . aaliyah's standout fashion sense made her a hot commodity among the fashion crowd: she modeled for tommy hilfiger, who showcased her tomboy appeal -- baggy jeans and a tight-fitting shirt -- and was featured on the covers of many magazines with that trendsetting hair swoop over her left eye. her influence on the music game is still relevant today. she has inspired artists from singer-rapper drake to pop superstar beyonce. ciara, who is best known for her singing and dancing moves, has an aaliyah-inspired stage presence and dressing style. singer-songwriter tank, who worked closely with aaliyah on her last two albums, spoke with concrete loop earlier this year about where she would be right now if she were alive. she would be at the top and there would probably be a few people who wouldn't have careers, he said. if you think about it, she was already on top. at the time of her death, she had three top-selling albums under her belt, many nominations and awards and was slated to have a big role in the matrix reloaded and matrix revolution movies. she had just completed her work on the film, queen of the damned and was already being sought after for other movie roles. not to mention, she had a solid and loyal fan base. however, the rest of her journey to superstardom just wasn't meant to be. a month before her untimely death, aaliyah granted mtv's show diary behind-the-scenes access to her fast-paced life and said, i am truly blessed to wake up every morning to do something that i love; there is nothing better than that. she continued, everything is worth it -- the hard work, the times when you're tired, the times when you are a bit sad. in the end, it's all worth it because it really makes me happy. i wouldn't trade it for anything else in the world. i've got good friends, a beautiful family and i've got a career. i thank god for his blessings every single chance i get. so, on august 25, blast aaliyah's timeless music loud and remember her for being a trendsetting force in fashion and for helping to redefine and take r b music to another level.

" source: nicolas cage asked assistant to find his son before beating by alan duke , cnn weston cage was placed under a psychiatric hold after los angeles police responded to the incident tuesday. story highlights new: cage's lawyer confirms the actor sent an assistant to find his son new: it doesn't justify a deliberate, provoked attack, cage's lawyer says weston cage's former personal assistant is being investigated in the 20-year-old's beating former assistant asks public to suspend their judgment until all of the facts come to light los angeles (cnn) -- the bloody beating of nicolas cage's son on a hollywood sidewalk last week followed a search for the 20-year-old because the actor wanted to see his son before leaving town, a source with knowledge of the incident said. a lawyer for cage said he was looking for weston because he didn't have his cell phone and he wanted to get in touch with him to do some recording. cage's request that the man he paid to be his son's assistant locate his son doesn't justify what occurred, which was a deliberate, provoked attack where weston was in no condition to defend himself, cage attorney martin singer said monday. the younger cage asked los angeles police to investigate the assistant, kevin villegas, for the alleged assault, according los angeles police sgt. john gomperz. villegas was fired after the incident last week. weston cage was placed under a psychiatric hold after los angeles police responded to the incident tuesday, but he was released over the weekend. cell phone video posted online showed weston cage being repeatedly hit as he was pinned down on a sidewalk. he wanted kevin to leave, and what happened, at least three witnesses told me, there was a provocation, singer said. weston threw a weak kick. he put weston down on the floor, and he began a barrage of punches, 13 to 15 to the face. i deeply lament the incident that occurred between me and weston last tuesday, villegas said, and plead with the media and the public to suspend their judgment of the episode until all of the facts come to light. the violent incident came amid a dispute between weston cage's mother, christina fulton, and nicolas cage over how to deal with their son's psychological issues, which are outlined in legal document filed in fulton's lawsuit against cage. she said she put her acting career on hold for two decades to raise the child while cage, one of hollywood's highest-paid actors, pursued his career. fulton is suing cage over unpaid taxes and the hollywood home where she raised weston, and is seeking to regain legal control over her son, who court documents say suffers from a number of mental, psychological and physical ailments. he lived with fulton after she and cage, who were never married, split up when weston was a child. villegas was hired several years ago as weston cage's personal wrestling coach when he was in high school. he later became a personal assistant to nicolas cage to help with his son. because of a confidentiality agreement, i am limited in what i can share publicly on this matter, villegas said. i'm grateful that weston is getting the care that he needs and wish him all the best. villegas was following orders from nicolas cage to find and hold on to his adult son the afternoon of the incident, said the source, who asked not to be identified because of legal and confidentiality issues. the older cage's lawyer denied the actor asked the assistant to hold on to his son. he only wanted to have the younger cage call his father, singer said. the source disputed an initial report that the fight began when villegas told weston cage he could not order a certain item from a restaurant menu. fulton blames nicolas cage for what she said is her son's downward spiral since he turned 18 and left her legal guardianship. i do not want him with nicolas cage, fulton said. i do not want him in that care. that is not the care my son needs. weston cage, in a statement delivered through his father's lawyer friday afternoon, said that he did not want his mother to be involved in his care. i am an adult, weston cage said. i don't want to have anything to do with my mother. any problems that i have ever had is because of the relationship that i had with my mother. when fulton heard the quote, she called it an absolute disgrace, suggesting that cage's lawyer solicited a statement from her son while he was under a psychiatric hold at ronald reagan ucla medical center. my son is under a spell. he's under a trance, fulton said. weston would say whatever his dad wants him to say. fulton said it is nicolas cage's fault that their son is in a hospital. he had his chance, she said of the elder cage. he had his chance to make it right. my son had a healthy environment here. he had a system that was fantastic. i built that with myself and my team. she said she fired villegas three years ago, but nicolas cage rehired him, she said. nicolas cage, in a statement from his spokeswoman friday, called fulton's comments blaming him for his son's psychiatric troubles unfortunate and inappropriate. this is a time to focus only on giving love and full support to weston, not an opportunity to lay blame on his father, a man who loves his son very deeply, cage said. fulton said cage was rarely around for her son growing up, while she dealt with his medical and psychological issues. for 18 years, i raised weston so nicolas could go be nicolas cage, and go be a superstar, and he did, she said. so i raised this boy, 24/7, we were glued to the hip. after weston's 18th birthday, his father orchestrated his removal from her care by persuading the employees she hired to work for him and giving weston his own home and money, fulton said. they all go work with nicolas cage because he has the money and he has the bank account and he has the fame, and i don't, she said. weston's special needs were not being met without her, she said. my son right now has been under the care of nicolas, she said. that didn't work. it's very obvious it didn't work. it failed miserably, failed miserably. singer, cage's lawyer, said fulton's lawsuit against cage is her motivation for attacking her son's father. ms. fulton comments about mr. cage are absurd, and it's very unfortunate that she would lash out like this because her son does not want to have anything to do with her, singer said. this is clearly all about money for ms. fulton. fulton's lawyer said she would file for conservatorship of her son next week so she could ensure that he will get the care he needs when he is eventually released from the psychiatric hold. i'd like my son to be with his mom, where it worked, fulton said. i'd like my son to be in an environment where it worked. you know, 18 years of being successful, 18 years of watching my son respond to all the medical intervention that i have given him and all the support. why would you mess with that? why would you interfere with that? my son needs to be home.
