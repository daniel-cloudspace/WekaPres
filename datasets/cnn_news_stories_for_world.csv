(cnn) -- no country has a higher life expectancy than monaco -- and it's not even close. the average life expectancy in the tiny european principality is 89.73 years, according to the cia world factbook. that's a full five years more than macau, which was second on the list at 84.41. it's also 10 years more than the united states, which comes in at no. 49 with an average life expectancy of 78.37. the world average is 67.07. twenty-nine nations have life expectancies over 80, but there are also eight under 50. it might not be surprising that afghanistan (45.02) is part of that eight. the rest are african countries, including last-place angola (38.76), which is still rebuilding from a 27-year civil war that ended in 2002. angola also has the highest crude death rate in the world, with 23.4 deaths a year for every 1,000 people, the cia world factbook says. more comparisons which countries have the most vacation days? who requires the most education? who's got the highest (and lowest) unemployment rates?

" in the rixos hotel, karadsheh wasn't ready for life's wild ride to end. phoning home to say goodbye it had become apparent days earlier that the journalists -- from an array of news organizations, including bbc, reuters, fox and china's cctv -- were prisoners of a dying gadhafi regime. the government officials and minders who'd monitored the journalists abandoned the hotel august 21. about 15 gunmen loyal to the regime remained behind, roaming the halls with russian assault rifles. they told the journalists they could not leave the hotel. most of the loyalists were irritable, young, reckless. they adorned their weapons with the green flag of gadhafi's regime. to avoid contact with this volatile bunch, the journalists moved to an upper floor. a hotel chef initially took care of the group. one 21-year-old gunman -- a nice guy, karadsheh says -- ran through the hotel with his jeans covered in the blood of his cousin, killed in the fighting outside. by monday, tensions between the journalists and their captors escalated. gunfire erupted outside the hotel, and smoke could be seen coming from the direction of gadhafi's nearby compound. the gunmen were enraged. nato spies, they shouted. there are spies amongst the journalists! they walked amid the journalists, their guns drawn. they were angry, bitter. this could really turn out terribly for us, chance thought. the journalists tried not to antagonize. we all had a calm panic, if there is such a thing, he recalled. the gunmen's belligerence sparked paranoia about being taken hostage, about being held prisoner, about being executed. it dawned on us: if they'd been given orders to take us as prisoners or to execute us, there was nothing we could do. that loss of control -- the realization that their fate rested with the men holding guns -- led to the darkest thoughts: that they wouldn't make it out alive. chance phoned his mother and wife to tell them what to do with his remains. his wife put his 5-year-old daughter on the line. if this was a final goodbye, his only child needed to hear daddy's voice. the veteran correspondent who has covered conflicts in the balkans, chechnya, iraq and afghanistan didn't tell his girl about the danger he faced. he spoke instead of the new school year. you're going to start school in two weeks, he said. promise me that you'll work really hard at school. yes, poppa, i promise you. be a good girl for me and mommy. poppa, i will. his heart sank. he was 2,000 miles from his home in moscow. he wanted nothing more than to see his girl on her first day of school. he just wasn't sure if he'd make it. fighting intensified outside. snipers fired into the hotel, shattering windows and rattling nerves. chance and the others spent 36 hours face-down on the floor with little food or water. with frequent power outages, it was difficult to follow the events of tripoli outside the walls of the hotel. but work kept chance focused. he tweeted using his smartphone, used a satellite phone or called friends and dictated his thoughts. at one point tuesday, he leaned over a balcony overlooking the hotel's interior courtyard, which the gunmen patrolled. i suppose you're happy now that libyans are killing libyans, one shouted. connecting as a human the sound of artillery fire pierced the morning calm wednesday. journalists rustled awake. the gunmen had grown increasingly hostile the day before. the group worried about what lay in store. about 6 a.m., all of the gunmen except the older one left the hotel. karadsheh and the arabic-speaking cameraman approached him. a day earlier, she had overheard him telling the younger gunmen to remain calm and be good to the journalists: we want them to go back to their countries and say good things about us -- how libyans are brave people. now karadsheh and the cameraman told him what they understood: gadhafi's regime had fallen. when a man who called himself a soldier entered the hotel, the gunman asked about the situation outside. you were out there. tell me, what's really going on? is it what they are telling us? yes, he was told. the rebels were indeed in control. gadhafi's rule of libya was over. karadsheh seized the moment with an emotional plea. her family missed her, she told him, as did the families of the three dozen other journalists. think about your kids, she said. you're left here alone. just let us go. at first, the man defended gadhafi, saying that he had brought democracy to libya, that the nation thrived under his leadership. earlier, he'd told karadsheh that he was protecting the journalists. that he wanted his children to know that he'd fight to the end. karadsheh and the cameraman reminded him that all the senior officials -- and now even his young comrades -- had abandoned him. it was time to give up. slowly, he started to change. the cameraman slowly stripped the soldier and gunman of their weapons. now unarmed, the man looked at the journalists and said, you can go now. karadsheh immediately began negotiating with the international committee of the red cross to get cars to the hotel. before she left, she told the man goodbye. jomana, get out of here, he said. go back home. libya is over. there will be a bloodbath for years to come. chance watched nearby as his colleague talked with the guard. i watched this transformation these guys made from being gadhafi hardliners to realizing that his regime was a historically past moment. that was a remarkable transition to witness. i think it's the most moving part of this whole crisis. says karadsheh: in the end, we're all human. and that's what this was about, connecting with him as a human. stepping outside the rixos, the journalists worried about snipers. there were none. cars with the bbc and the international committee of the red cross pulled up. they piled inside. rixos crisis ends. all journalists are out! chance tweeted. in the car, he called cnn. speeding through tripoli, he described the end of their hellish ordeal. karadsheh sat next to him, tears streaming down her face, the weight of recent days crashing down. we wouldn't be here if it weren't for her, chance said later. but karadsheh praised the cameraman. it was a team effort. chance's daughter will soon see her poppa. he plans to be home for her first day of school september 5. but first he stopped at the newly named martyr square, where joyous tripoli residents showered him with flowers. they're not celebrating my freedom, he said. they're celebrating libya's freedom. karadsheh was struck by the disparate scene from a week ago, when tripoli was filled with unhappy faces. today, she noted, everyone seemed to wear smiles. gadhafi's images have been torn down. i came out to a new libya, she said. on thursday, the day after her release, she did the unthinkable. she returned to the hotel to gather her personal belongings. i got a bit freaked out when we got close, she said. but the first thing i saw was a rebel flag hanging on the rixos. i felt comfortable. soon, she was back in a car, crossing the border into tunisia, headed home. as she'd told the gunman, she longs to see her loved ones. cnn's paul armstrong contributed to this report.

" libya has always relied on foreign expertise to exploit its oil, but expatriate workers may be reluctant to return before the violence -- and the threat of abduction -- abates. the waters off tripoli, where heavy gunbattles continued thursday, contain important fields like the bahr essalam. but in the east, too, there are still pockets of fighters loyal to deposed leader moammar gadhafi and there are ongoing clashes. spanish oil company repsol said last month that its assets in libya were intact, but said staff would only return to the country when fighting ceased and it would take at least four weeks to resume production. marathon oil, based in houston, said it has had preliminary talks with the national transitional council about restoring production when the situation stabilizes. the worst scenario for the ntc -- and the oil companies -- is a prolonged campaign of sabotage by opponents of libya's new rulers. wood mckenzie noted that gadhafi supporters sabotaged the pumping station that moved oil from the sarir and messia fields early in the conflict and said: libya's oil fields are located in the vast, remote saharan desert, making them impossible to defend from attack. other analysts point out that only now, after a prolonged insurgency, is iraq's oil output recovering to pre-invasion levels. rehabilitating the oil industry is one of the ntc's priorities because oil has provided 95% of the state's export revenue. while libya's new rulers will benefit from the release of the old regime's assets and international aid, they need a predictable revenue stream. a short journey across the mediterranean, libya is the ideal source for southern europe, with its plentiful reserves of light sweet crude, a high-quality oil. some european refiners are not equipped to process sour crude, industry experts said, and that has intensified competition for other sources (mainly nigerian) of high-quality oil in the absence of libyan exports. however unpredictable the current situation, european oil companies are gearing up for battle. the major players from there before the uprising began were italy's eni, total of france and repsol. british giant bp is also trying to get a larger slice of libyan exploration projects. it concluded a $900 million deal with the gadhafi regime three years ago to explore for gas. other players include omv of austria and marathon. china, through its state-owned cnpc, had begun exploring off the libyan coast to help feed its insatiable appetite for africa's mineral wealth but recently terminated several contracts because of the unrest. eni has been lobbying hard to retain its dominant role, concerned that total may get preferential treatment from the new government because of france's leading role in the military campaign to oust gadhafi. company officials said eni has been in regular contact with the rebels since april and ceo paolo scaroni predicted a positive future for eni in libya. scaroni is to visit libya next week to sign an agreement to supply gas for vehicles and natural gas to make electricity. italy has moved quickly to unblock libyan assets worth more than $500 million. but there may be concern in rome that senior ntc member mahmoud jibril headed for paris before rome. some ntc officials have suggested that those states most heavily involved in the conflict against the gadhafi regime -- which include britain, france and qatar -- will have an advantage when it comes to reconstruction projects. other states -- like russia, brazil and china -- that opposed action against the gadhafi regime may find it an uphill battle with libya's new rulers. tarhouni told reuters on thursday that all current contracts would be honored. he said it was far too early to contemplate new contracts. it's the last thing on my mind, he told reuters. ntc officials have also pledged to reform the notoriously corrupt national oil company, often used as a piggy bank by the gadhafi family. "
" on thursday, diplomats will converge in istanbul for a meeting of the libya contact group, a coalition of arab and european governments. representatives from the united states and turkey will also attend. many of these governments threw their weight behind the libyan rebels by freezing the assets of libyan leader moammar gadhafi's government and pledging military and financial support to the council in benghazi. the group will discuss the next steps to be taken at the political level, said unal. it will be no surprise if they also discuss the financial aspect of the crisis. "
" state department spokeswoman victoria nuland said participants were looking forward to a high-level meeting of allies in paris next week. italy will unfreeze about $505 million in libyan assets that have been held in italian banks, italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said thursday. the rebels have already gotten some support. mustafa abdul jalil, chairman of the transitional council, revealed that turkey had sent $300 million to the rebels since july. the expected release of financing for humanitarian aid came as a few signs appeared on the streets of the capital that indicated a lessening of tensions in some neighborhoods. for the first time in days, a few stores opened and more residents were out on the streets. but fighting continued in pockets as the rebels hustled to consolidate power and much of the city remained a no-go zone. weapons littered the streets in some areas. around one intersection, a dozen bodies lay on the ground, their hands bound behind them. rebels said they had been executed by gadhafi's men, but that was not clear. the victims were black africans, who composed a large part of gadhafi's army, raising the specter of the revenge killings that clinton has cautioned against. the opposition has posted a $1.4 million bounty for gadhafi's capture or death. though he hasn't been reported seen since rebel forces began advancing last weekend into the libyan capital, he appeared to have issued another audio message in which he exhorted his followers to fight for control of the capital. tripoli is for you, men and women, the speaker said. go out, go out and free tripoli. destroy them wherever they are, fight them. let the crowds from everywhere march to tripoli. the speaker added, libya is for you and not for france or its president, nicolas sarkozy. france is a leader in the nato mission in libya. do not leave tripoli for the rats, do not leave them. fight them, destroy them. you are the overwhelming majority, you have marched in millions. march with the same millions but fight this time. fill the streets and the fields, the speaker said. gadhafi has previously described his adversaries as rats. do not be afraid of bombing, you will not be hit. do not be afraid at all. they are just stun grenades to scare you. do not be afraid at all, do not surrender tripoli. cnn cannot independently confirm who was speaking in the recording. special forces from britain, france, jordan and qatar -- on the ground in libya -- have stepped up operations in support of the rebels in tripoli and other cities. but a senior opposition official said much of the capital's southern neighborhoods remained dangerous. we have 80% of tripoli liberated, said hisham abu hajer, the coordinator of the rebels' brigades in tripoli. the two suburbs of abu salim and al hadba al khadra remain contested and fierce fighting with gadhafi forces continues. witnesses told cnn that fighting between rebels and gadhafi loyalists erupted thursday at the embattled leader's compound, the scene of a number of clashes in recent days. a giant plume of smoke rose from the compound in bab al-aziziya two days after it was seized by rebels. rebels controlled tripoli's international airport, but were struggling to secure an area east of it. gadhafi loyalists destroyed an empty libyan airline passenger plane parked at the airport thursday -- the third plane destroyed in 24 hours. the tripoli airport is under the control of the rebels, but it is still being shelled by gadhafi forces with grad missiles, abu hajer said. nato is trying to learn how many surface-to-air missiles and launchers may still be operational inside libya and who controls them, a nato official told cnn thursday. several months ago, the u.s. military estimated libya had an arsenal of 20,000 sams, but it was not clear how many may have been destroyed during the conflict and who has control of the remaining missiles. the state department's nuland also said the 10 tons of mustard gas stored at the waddan ammunition reservation in libya are secure inside massive steel containers within heavy bunkers. but nuland also referred to discussions with the transitional council about taking over external security of the facility, raising the question about who is now watching over them. a u.s. official said the same libyan government unit that had been guarding the mustard gas stockpile is still doing so, an indication that gadhafi security forces were still present. but the official said monitoring of the facility has determined they have neither abandoned their posts, nor tried to gain access to the materials. the materials are secure, guarded and not disturbed, said the official. at hospitals across tripoli, overwhelmed doctors and nurses attempt to care for the wounded. robin waudo, a spokesman for the international committee of the red cross, said two surgical teams were en route from europe with the first scheduled to arrive friday. in gadhafi's hometown of sirte, the ntc said it was negotiating with the longtime ruler's tribal leaders for their surrender without bloodshed. abu hajer said the process of moving government ministries from the opposition base in benghazi to the capital has inched forward, with about four or five ministerial level officials of the ntc already in tripoli. in the oil-rich city of al-brega, several crude oil storage tanks continued burning more than six days after they were set ablaze by retreating gadhafi troops, said ramadan shalash, the refinery fire chief. cnn's joe vaccarello, richard roth,

" story highlights iceland has more gender equality than any country, according to the world economic forum the united states ranks 19th out of 134 countries in the 2010 global gender gap index many factors are considered, including educational opportunity and political representation editor's note: each friday, cnn will examine statistics or world rankings to show how countries and territories compare with one another. who's the best? who's the worst? and where does the united states fit in? you'll find those answers in our country comparisons series. (cnn) -- how narrow is the gender gap in the united states compared to some other countries? check out how the u.s. stacks up on the 40th anniversary of women's equality day -- established by the u.s. congress as every august 26 (the day the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote was passed). four nordic countries rank at the top of the global gender gap index released last year by the world economic forum. iceland, norway, finland and sweden were considered to have the smallest gap between men and women when four key areas were taken into account: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. no. 1 iceland scored a 0.8496 on a scale of 0-1, with 1 being perfect equality between men and women. the lowest country on the list, yemen, scored a 0.4603. the united states came in near the top of the overall index, ranking 19th out of 134 countries. it tied for first with 21 other countries that received a perfect score in the educational attainment category. it also ranked sixth in economic participation and opportunity. where it might have room for improvement, however, is in health and survival (38th) and political empowerment (40th). the health and survival category looks at the gaps between life expectancies and sex ratios within a country. the political empowerment category measures female representation in government and other decision-making structures. many of the countries that rank near the bottom of the global gender gap index are muslim-majority countries in the middle east and north africa. more comparisons: where is the internet most popular? where are the undernourished? where do people live the longest? which countries have the most vacation days? who requires the most education? who's got the highest (and lowest) unemployment rates?

" as for the airport, rebels said they controlled the facility, but were struggling to secure an area east of it controlled by gadhafi loyalists. they claim gadhafi loyalists have been indiscriminately shelling the airport from a civilian village east of the facility in an effort to repel the advance of rebel forces. rebels say they are cautious in their response to the incoming fire because of the civilian casualties. one aircraft burned as loyalists resumed mortar and grad rocket shelling of the airport, according to a cnn team that witnessed the attack. this comes amid world concerns over revenge killings by rebels and loyalists. amnesty international has gathered accounts from survivors of abuse in zawiya by pro-gadhafi soldiers and rebel forces. it also issued a report on friday about the killings of detainees in tripoli by gadhafi loyalists. evidence emerged of executions in the battle for tripoli. a dozen bodies, with their hands bound behind them, were discovered near gadhafi's compound in tripoli where fierce fighting erupted thursday. rebels at the scene told cnn they had been executed by gadhafi's men, but it was not immediately clear. the victims were black africans, who composed a large part of gadhafi's army. the discovery of the bodies came a day after a doctor at a tripoli hospital told cnn that he had examined a number of dead rebels who appeared to have been executed with a bullet to the head. on the political front, the opposition national transitional council has announced it is moving its political base to tripoli from its strong in benghazi in eastern libya. libya's rebel leadership on friday pleaded urgently with the united states and other countries to unfreeze billions of dollars, saying the funds are vital to establish peace and stability in the nation. our friends throughout the world are talking about the procedures needed to bring back peace and stability, mahmoud jibril, a senior ntc leader, told reporters at an international conference in turkey. but we cannot do that unless we can fulfill our duties. his call for funds came a day after the u.n. security council's sanctions committee approved a u.s. request to free up $1.5 billion of the at least $100 billion in libyan assets frozen at the start of the war. the national transitional council has been recognized by nations and alliances across the globe. the peace and security council of the african union failed to do so at a friday meeting. neverthless, the council issued a communique that urged the formation of an inclusive transitional government. it called for the establishment of a constitutional and legislative framework for the democratic transformation of libya, as well as for support towards the organization of elections and the national reconciliation process. it encouraged the libyan stakeholders to accelerate the process leading to the formation of an all-inclusive transitional government that would be welcome to occupy the seat of libya in the au, which represents countries across africa. cnn's dan rivers, sara sidner, arwa damon, raja razek, jomana karadsheh, hada messia, barbara starr, chelsea j. carter and pam benson contributed to this report.

" he condemned the car bombing but would not speculate on who might be responsible. the attack targeted a building that housed 26 u.n. humanitarian and development agencies, he said, adding: this was an assault on those who devote their lives to helping others. ban said he was sending the deputy secretary general and the chief of u.n. security to abuja, where they will try to determine who is responsible. yushau shuaib, a spokesman for nigeria's national emergency management agency, said the driver of the vehicle used in the bombing had passed through the first and second gates of the compound before detonating the explosives by the building's reception area. a witness outside the u.n. building at the time of the attack told cnn she had seen a white suv drive quickly through the main gate of the compound. she then heard two explosions in quick succession, the second one much larger and followed by the shattering of glass. images from the scene showed severe damage to the bottom floors of the building, with windows blown in and debris scattered around. people who were in the u.n. building told cnn that after the explosion, a wall fell on some people, causing several casualties. u.k. foreign secretary william hague said he was shocked by the attack. this brutal act has killed and injured many innocent people, and i utterly condemn those who have carried it out, he said. around the world the u.n. works for peace, security and international cooperation and an attack on the u.n. is an attack on these principles. alessandra vellucci at the united nations offices in geneva, switzerland, confirmed that the u.n. premises in abuja have been bombed but was unable to give more details. the building is home to the main u.n missions operating in nigeria and may have had as many as 400 people inside. cnn's alkasim abdulkadir said the area was not very busy because it was a diplomatic district, with the liberian and u.s. embassies nearby, but there were people working there. a spokeswoman for the u.s. embassy in abuja, deborah maclean, told cnn that there had been no damage to the embassy building, which is half a mile from the u.n. building. embassy personnel were initially told to be careful in case of further violence, she said. zoran jovanovic, head of mission for the international red cross in abuja, said the explosion was heard at 10:15 a.m. the u.n. building is in a large compound that has five gates, jovanovic said, adding that the area is also home to western african embassies. it is not yet clear who was responsible for the attack. the nigerian capital has experienced a series of bombings recently. in june, a car blast killed at least five people at the police headquarters in the city. it detonated less than two minutes after the federal police chief entered the building, a security source said at the time. a month later, at least three people died in an explosion near a church outside the capital. the number of casualties could have been higher if services had still been going on, according to a police spokesman. in october, at least 12 people died when car bombs exploded as the nation celebrated 50 years of independence. the attacks near the justice ministry injured about 50. the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta claimed responsibility for the october attack. mend, an umbrella organization of several rebel groups, is battling the government for fairer distribution of oil wealth. recent attacks, including on the church and police station, may have been the work of a radical muslim sect, boko haram, the nation's officials said this year. boko haram aims to enforce a strict version of sharia law in the nation. africa's most populous nation is divided between a largely christian south and a muslim north. cnn's alkasim abdulkadir, umaro djau, christian purefoy, ben brumfield, stephanie halasz, david wilkinson and claudia rebaza contributed to this report.

" port-au-prince, haiti (cnn) -- five years ago, patrice millet learned he was in the advanced stages of a rare bone cancer. a stem cell transplant was his only hope for survival. the businessman from haiti underwent the procedure in the united states. after nine months of treatment and recovery, his cancer was in remission. millet returned home in may 2007 determined to start living the life he'd always wanted: helping children from haiti's poorest slums have a brighter future. every day you see so many kids in need -- so many bad stories, tragic stories, said millet, 49. all my life, i wanted to do something good for my country, for the kids. (so) i said, 'this is the time. i have nothing to lose.' that summer, millet sold his construction supply business and started a program called fondaps , which stands for foundation notre-dame du perp tuel secours (foundation of our lady of perpetual help). the program uses soccer to help children stay out of trouble and learn valuable life skills. millet calls it education by sport. i want the kids to be very good citizens, he said. in soccer ... you need to give, you need to receive, you need team spirit, discipline, sportsmanship. ... it's not all about soccer, it's about life. millet started by focusing his efforts on children from solino, one of port-au-prince's most dangerous slums. but going into the neighborhood to recruit young participants was risky. my wife didn't want me to go. she said gangs (would) kill me. but millet was undeterred. i said, 'i'd rather die doing something good than die in bed.' while millet was first greeted with suspicion, he was eventually accepted by the locals and children flocked to join his program. today, hundreds of children have benefited from fondaps. do you know a hero? nominations are open for 2011 cnn heroes soccer programs for children are rare in haiti, and players generally must pay to participate. in millet's program, the equipment, uniforms, shoes and training are all free for participants. he also pays the transportation and entry fees for players to compete in soccer tournaments. when you live in the ghetto, you don't see the world outside, he said. i try to bring hope for them, ... to show them that (their) life is not only the reality. before the earthquake hit haiti in january 2010, millet's program had expanded to three neighborhoods and involved more than 600 children, including more than 150 girls. but the quake devastated solino and halted fondaps' momentum. one of the children in the program died and many lost friends and family members. when the earthquake came ... it became harder for the kids, millet said. now, most of them live in tents. ... they have to fight for everything. two of the three fields where millet had held soccer practice became large tent cities. his remaining field is located on the outskirts of port au prince -- too far for many of his former players to walk. but about 200 boys still make the journey. millet believes that the difficult times have only increased the need for his work. in port-au-prince right now, there is almost no soccer field, he said. it's very important for a kid to play. ... i try to give them joy, give them their childhood. the children, ages 9-17, practice five days a week. and millet often arranges games on sundays. when they win, they are happy and they know that it's because they worked hard for it. ... that is the message i want to tell them, said millet. sometimes you win, sometime you lose. ... but this is the way you win in life. since many of his kids, as he calls them, lack father figures, millet also acts as a role model and mentor. after practice, he and the other coaches regularly talk with the boys about what's going on in their lives. millet constantly stresses the importance of education to them, and at times dips into his own pocket to pay their school fees. they don't have to steal ... or (join a) gang. they know that they can do something. they know they can believe in themselves, said millet. while fondaps is basically a one-man operation run on a shoestring budget, millet is always looking for other ways to help his players. usually once a week, participants receive packets of pasta, rice and beans to bring home to their families. he is also working on getting a bus to transport children to practice, and he hopes to one day establish his own school with athletic fields and programs in music and art. despite the challenges to keep his program going, millet is not lacking in motivation. to see the joy in the face of a kid ... and you know what he's living (through) ... that makes me happy, he said. it's so wonderful to see the progress they make in soccer, in their own life, in everything. for jeff fouvant, millet's program has been a lifeline. the 11-year-old lost his father in the earthquake and is living in a tent with 10 family members. fouvant's entire family depends on the food he receives from fondaps, and millet also pays for his school fees. mr. patrice ... he helped us a lot, said fouvant. he is a hero. in 2009, millet's cancer returned, but he's treating it with medication. he recently spent several weeks in the u.s. undergoing radiation treatment, but he insists that he's feeling good. though cancer is a reality that millet can't escape, he said he's happier now than he was before his diagnosis. and he's determined to do as much as he can with whatever time he has left. i realized how important life is, every moment, he said. i am not ready to die yet. i have many, many things to do. want to get involved? check out the fondaps website at www.fondaps.com and see how to help.

" the cone of uncertainty -- the area that could be affected by irene depending on what path it follows over the next several days -- includes much of the northeast. even if the hurricane does not make landfall, heavy rain could trigger flooding. the biggest concern is getting people to pay attention and make sure they are ready, federal emergency management agency administrator craig fugate said in an interview with cnn. residents should have the necessary supplies and an evacuation plan ready, he said. the storm could weaken as it works its way up the u.s. east coast in the coming days. as it gets closer to the northeast, it will run into the cooler labrador current, and that -- along with some more wind shear -- should allow irene to lose some strength, said hln meteorologist bob van dillen. the u.s. navy is sending 27 ships based in norfolk, virginia, out to sea to ride out irene, a senior navy official told cnn. an aircraft carrier is among them. another 28 ships will seek more sheltered areas. three submarines were heading out to sea as well. new york mayor michael bloomberg said vulnerable patients in possibly affected hospitals, nursing homes and senior homes must be moved by 8 p.m. et friday. south carolina state officials have decided not to order evacuations but urged boaters and swimmers to stay out of the water. the last major hurricane to strike the united states was wilma in 2005, which was a category 3 at landfall in southwest florida, jeras said. cnn's josh levs, ed payne, melanie whitley, phil gast, catherine e. schoichet, joe sutton, greg botelho, chris boyette, paul corson, eden pontz, laura batchelor, barbara starr and john fricke contributed to this report.

" tokyo, japan (cnn) -- japanese prime minister naoto kan, whose approval rating tumbled following the devastating march earthquake and tsunami, announced his resignation friday. kan announced he is stepping down as party leader during a meeting with members of the ruling democratic party of japan. the party will elect a new leader next week, who will take over as prime minister. the resignation fulfills his promise to step down after parliament approved two pieces of legislation, including one related to post-earthquake reconstruction. i will put my words into action once those two bills are approved, kan said this month at a lower house committee session. kan believes the two bills -- the deficit-financing bond bill and the new energy promotion bill -- will push forward his reconstruction policies. the bills passed friday. kan has been under pressure to resign since the march 11 earthquake and tsunami and subsequent nuclear crisis in the nation. the disaster triggered the worst nuclear crisis since chernobyl, as cores overheated and spewed radioactive material into surrounding areas. soon after the disaster, ratings agency moody's put the country debt under review for a possible downgrade, as political infighting undermined measures to fix the budget deficit. moody's officially downgraded japan's credit on wednesday, citing its unstable politics in june, the embattled leader narrowly escaped a vote of no confidence in parliament. as many as nine candidates, including finance minister yoshihiko noda and former foreign minister, seiji maehara, are considered possible contenders for the post of prime minister. kan's resignation allows him to remain in office until the ruling party elects its new leader, a move scheduled for monday. a day later, parliament will vote in the new leader as prime minister, the sixth premier for the nation in five years. japan's next prime minister will inherit a series of problems, including soaring debt, nuclear woes, a shrinking population and a nation struggling to rebuild after the devastating earthquake and tsunami.

" (cnn) -- an 80-year old austrian man has been taken into custody for allegedly sexually abusing his wife and his two mentally disabled daughters for more than 40 years, police and a prosecutor said thursday. we fear that he might bother his victims or continue to abuse women, chief prosecutor alois ebner, who ordered the arrest, told cnn. the man's wife died three years ago, investigators said, but the daughters still lived with their father in the northwestern town of braunau. they slept on a wooden bench and were threatened by their father with a pitchfork, authorities said. he isolated the two women from the outside world for all the time, said ernestine heger, another prosecutor in the case. police freed the two sisters in may 2011, after a social worker brought their allegations to authorities. the man had fallen on the floor that month and could not get up, officials said, and his daughters refused to help him for two days. the women then entrusted themselves to a social worker, who informed police about the situation. after being treated in a hospital, the man was transferred to a nursing home in braunau while the case was being investigated, authorities said. the two daughters have not yet been questioned by prosecutors. according to austrian law, they can refuse to testify. in 2008, austrian josef fritzl was arrested after having imprisoned and raped his daughter for 24 years. he was convicted on charges of incest, rape, false imprisonment, assault and murder and sentenced to life in prison in 2009. the murder charge was for allowing one of the babies he fathered with his daughter to die shortly after birth. heger said that in contrast to the fritzl case, the sisters in braunau were not really imprisoned. although they could not move where they wanted, neighbors have seen them several times throughout the years, she explained. the two sisters are now in psychological care, officials said.

" in 1986, libya was implicated in the fatal bombing at a west berlin nightclub that left one american service member dead, prompting then-u.s. president ronald reagan to dub the libyan leader the mad dog of the middle east. reagan ordered the united states to bomb libya and imposed economic sanctions against the north african country. two years later, libya was implicated in the 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103, which exploded over lockerbie, scotland. years later, gadhafi appeared to moderate and seek rapprochement with the west. in 1999, he turned over suspects in the lockerbie bombing, and in 2003 the country agreed to eliminate weapons of mass destruction. in the years before the current rebellion started, gadhafi even hired a public relations firm to burnish his global image as a statesman and a reformer. starting in 2006, the leader spent about $3 million a year to execute a public relations strategy that included paying think-tank analysts and former government officials to take a free trip to libya for lectures, discussions and personal meetings with gadhafi. in 2009, he addressed the u.n. general assembly for the first and only time. in his 96-minute ramble, he denounced the security council as a terror council, suggested the h1n1 swine-flu virus was a military tool and called for renewed investigations into the assassinations of john f. kennedy and martin luther king, jr. earlier this year, as people around the middle east and north africa began to challenge their leaders in the so-called arab spring movement, gadhafi found himself a target. but while longtime egyptian president hosni mubarak was ousted after a few weeks, and even after the eastern libyan city of benghazi fell to the rebels, gadhafi fought on and blamed outsiders, armed gangs and others for the violence. in the end, the libyan leader sealed his reputation with his crackdown on protesters and attacks against rebels and civilians alike. recently, international leaders accused gadhafi's regime of committing human rights violations and killing civilians. the u.n. security council subsequently issued a no-fly zone over libya and approved all necessary measures short of invasion to protect civilians. officials in the gadhafi regime, in turn, repeatedly accused nato of killing civilians in airstrikes. in april, gadhafi wrote a letter to u.s. president barack obama, urging him to end the nato bombing of his war-torn country. gadhafi asked obama to stop what he called the unjust war against a small people of a developing country, adding that those in the opposition are terrorists and members of al qaeda. the nato operations continued, however. in june, the international criminal court issued arrest warrants for gadhafi, his son saif al-islam gadhafi, and his brother-in-law abdullah al-sanussi. the warrants are for crimes against humanity, including murder and persecution, allegedly committed across libya from february 15 through at least february 28, through the state apparatus and security forces, the court said in a statement. cnn's mike pearson, greg botelho and catherine shoichet contributed to this report.

" they are taking precautions, sydney jenkins, bar manager at poor richard's sandwich shop in manteo, said wednesday evening. it's now more or less whether it's even going to hit us. this is a huge storm, said cnn meteorologist jacqui jeras. the cloud field is more than 800 miles across. the tropical storm force winds extend out 200 miles from the center. the strengthening came as the storm pounded central and southeastern bahamas. rainfall of 6 to 12 inches was expected in the bahamas, with 15 inches possible in some places, the miami-based hurricane center said. at 11 p.m. et wednesday, irene was moving northwest at 12 mph and was between rum cay and long island, 150 miles east-southeast of nassau. hurricane-force winds extended up to 70 miles and u.s. weather officials predicted significant storm surge. we are urging persons in central bahamas to exercise extreme caution, said capt. stephen russell, head of the national emergency management agency in the island chain. no injuries had been reported as of wednesday evening, but extensive structural damage from wind was reported on acklins and crooked islands, russell told cnn. numerous homes had been blown off their foundations. russell had no information on rainfall amounts. electricity was out in some locations. irene whipped through the island of mayaguana, the mostly easterly island in the chain, and moved into long, san salvador and cat islands, which are not heavily populated. about 65% of the country's population is on new providence, home to nassau. projections showed the island being outside of hurricane-force winds, russell said. we hope the system makes a gradual turn to the northeast. after it makes the turn, irene could threaten large sections of the eastern seaboard, from the carolinas into the northeast. but, forecasters said, it was too soon to predict how it would affect the united states because of the cone of uncertainty. even if irene doesn't touch land or glances off the u.s. coast, the waves are going to be tremendous, said cnn meteorologist chad myers. swells generated by irene will begin affecting the southeast's coast thursday. on the forecast track, the core of irene will move across the southeastern and central bahamas through tonight and over the northwestern bahamas on thursday, the hurricane center said. irene forced more than a dozen cruise ships to change their itineraries in the caribbean, cruisecritic.com reported. those ships include the carnival sensation, which had been docked in freeport, bahamas, but was coming back to port canaveral, florida, late wednesday. irene has prompted the bahamas ministry of tourism aviation to recommend strongly that people with plans to travel to the bahamas in the next few days postpone their trips. the storm will curve northward as it nears the united states, with most of the latest projections suggesting the storm will avoid landfall until it is north of north carolina. the storm is expected to arrive off north carolina by saturday morning. the storm approaches as americans increasingly are relying on social media to prepare for and keep abreast of disasters. according to two american red cross surveys, the increased use of social media and mobile technology has caused response agencies to engage with people in times of disaster and to include information from social networks in their response efforts. north carolina coastal areas could see about 6 inches of rain and tropical storm force winds. irene is forecast to be a category 2 or 3 storm when it reaches the u.s. east coast later friday or early saturday. many counties were taking a wait-and-see attitude on evacuations. warren lee, emergency management director in new hanover county, north carolina, said shelters likely will be opened. if the storm stays on current track, we don't expect a major impact and we will not issue an evacuation order plan right now. some computer models suggest new york or new jersey could be hit. everywhere from north carolina to massachusetts remains in the cone of uncertainty, jeras said. worst-case scenario, we could be looking at two landfalls, or we could be lucky and get a brush instead of a direct hit. ... even if irene doesn't make landfall in the united states, it may very well bring flooding rains, damaging winds and power outages to the northeast. planning is critical, and everyone needs to be ready with a disaster plan and a safety kit. chris martin, an employee at endeavor seafood in newport, rhode island, said a bridal shower is scheduled sunday in portsmouth for his fiancee. we're hoping to have it outside. martin is hoping the hurricane, if it actually affects the state, will not arrive until monday. hyde county, in north carolina's outer banks, declared a state of emergency for ocracoke island and the county's mainland, along with a mandatory evacuation for all visitors and a voluntary evacuation for residents. the mandatory evacuation will extend to residents beginning 5 a.m. thursday, hyde county emergency services said. ocracoke is reachable only by boat or private plane. while forecasts showed the storm moving further from the coast and toward the sea, north carolina gov. beverly perdue said wednesday, we must all prepare for the worst. in kill devil hills in the outer banks, locals who insist on staying through the storm were planning hurricane parties as they stocked up on water, canned food and flashlight batteries, said cnn ireporter penelope penn, who was in the area tuesday. the water was so calm and the sky so clear at the outer banks last night. it truly is calmest before a storm, penn added. on wednesday, penn was in nearby virginia beach, virginia. the last major hurricane to strike the united states was wilma in 2005, which was a category 3 at landfall, jeras said. hurricane katrina, earlier the same year, was also a category 3 at landfall. the most recent hurricane to make landfall in the united states was ike in 2008, which hit near galveston, texas, as a category 2. gloria in 1985 was the most recent hurricane to hit new york. it was a category 3 at landfall, the national hurricane center said. in 1991, hurricane bob hit massachusetts, a category 2 at landfall. bill read, director of the hurricane center, said irene could cause problems with flooding in northeastern states that have already had lots of rainfall this summer. widespread damage is possible from the coastal carolinas all the way up to the canadian maritimes, including the major cities of the northeast, cnn meteorologist dave hennen said. irene is expected to pass well east of florida, so only minimal effects are expected thursday and friday as the storm moves northward toward the carolinas. but the u.s. coast guard is worried boaters in south florida are taking the threat too lightly. officials expect heavy rip currents and beach erosion in miami. the most prudent thing to make sure mariners are not out this time tomorrow, capt. chris scraba said. south carolina state officials decided not to order evacuations. boaters and swimmers were urged by the coast guard to stay out of the water. cnn's ed

" la paz, bolivia (cnn) -- bolivia's government is accusing u.s. officials of meddling in the south american nation's internal affairs and fueling indigenous protests of a proposed highway project. an influential bolivian official called wednesday for the expulsion of the u.s. agency of international development, accusing the agency of promoting actions aimed at destabilizing the government. the expulsion of usaid should be ... an act of sovereignty, said juan ramon quintana, director of a bolivian government development agency and a former top presidential aide. his remarks came as hundreds of indigenous protesters trekked toward la paz, protesting the proposed construction of a highway through a national park where indigenous communities live. quintana showed documents that he said proved that officials from the agency were behind the movement. on sunday, bolivian president evo morales said the u.s. embassy officials had suspiciously been in touch with protest organizers -- pointing to a phone log that he said proved it. but embassy officials have denied supporting the protests, which are scheduled to last for weeks. we emphasize that neither the united states embassy in bolivia nor any other element of the u.s. government has given any support to the indigenous march, the u.s. embassy said in a statement. usaid did not immediately respond to a request for comment. the agency's website says it provided $52 million in aid money to bolivia in the 2010 fiscal year for projects related to health, development, economic growth and the environment. opposition politicians accuse morales and his government of using the united states as a scapegoat as a way to deflect attention away from issues raised by indigenous groups morales purports to defend. they are violating fundamental rights, the right to privacy, they are flagrantly violating it, said jaime navarro, a representative in the national unity party. and once again the government dusts off an old ghost when it finds itself facing situations like this, and tries to show a conspiracy. sacha llorenti, bolivia's interior minister, said the phone log was obtained legally. bolivia and the united states have had diminished relations since september 2008, when each country expelled the other's ambassador. morales, a strong proponent of the cultivation of coca plants -- the source of cocaine -- expelled the u.s. drug enforcement administration a month later. he also delivered a strong verbal criticism of the u.s. government at the united nations general assembly that year. last month morales told cnn en espa ol that he was afraid the u.s. government was plotting against him. days earlier, he told a convention of female of farm workers that he was worried u.s. authorities would plant something on his presidential plane while he attended the u.n. general assembly meeting in new york. they are preparing something to discredit us with drug trafficking, he said. journalist gloria carrasco contributed to this report.

" some of the worst-hit areas were cat, san salvador and long islands, each of which took direct hits, according to gayle outten-moncur of the national emergency management agency. there has been bad flooding in some areas, she said, in part due to storm surges. specifically, outten-moncur noted that there were reports of between two and three feet of water in homes on cat island, which is about 130 miles southeast of nassau and paradise island. on northern cat island, bahamas information services reported that a police station's roof had blown off. on the island of mayaguana, meanwhile, several churches reported damage that included some lost roofs, said the national emergency management agency. a high school's roof blew off on crooked island, where part of st. john the baptist church collapsed. and several homes were blown away on acklins island, part of the destruction of a large portion of the lovely settlement, according to the emergency management agency. even as the clean-up began, the bahamas ministry of tourism tried to reassure travelers that the islands should largely be open for business soon -- especially in new providence and grand bahama island, the site of freeport and the area closest to miami. in a statement late thursday afternoon, the ministry said an initial assessment ... on major tourism areas in nassau and grand bahama island indicates limited damage and points to a quick return to normal operations. specifically, the ministry said that cruise ports in both locales should open late thursday, with ships set to resume stopping there by saturday. government offices and banks will reopen monday. airports on those two islands should resume operations friday, it said, and assessments are under way on the other, mostly smaller airports elsewhere in the chain. the ministry noted that 6,000 guests made it through the storm at the country's largest resort, atlantis, adding that other resorts will be open for business as early as tomorrow. electricity remained out thursday afternoon for two-thirds of the customers on new providence, including von maur in nassau, who noted that cell phone service has continued uninterrupted. he said he's breathing easier knowing that his family, neighbors and friends appear to have escaped uninjured. and he said he was impressed by the hurricane's fury. once everybody knows everybody's ok, (a hurricane) is pretty awesome, he said. cnn's jim spellman in nassau, and greg botelho and phil gast in atlanta contributed to this report.

" (cnn) -- at least 53 people were killed and eight others injured in a reported grenade attack thursday at a casino in monterrey, mexico, the capital of nuevo leon, red cross officials said. the incident occurred around 4 p.m. local time (5 p.m. et) at the casino royale when two people aboard a vehicle arrived, and one threw three grenades into the building. there were conflicting unconfirmed reports from local media that the assailants poured gasoline on the building before setting it on fire. between 20 and 30 people were trapped in the casino because of debris from the explosions, said cmdr. angel flores with the green cross. video from the scene showed a burned-out building as firefighters made rescue attempts to break the wall of the facade of the casino to release the smoke inside the building. authorities had suspended rescue efforts thursday night for fear that the building could collapse. mexican president felipe calderon sent the following statement from his official twitter account (translated from spanish): with deep consternation, i express my solidarity with nuevo leon and the victims of this abhorrent act of terror and barbarism. he added more: these reprehensible acts require us all to persevere in the fight against gangs of unscrupulous criminals. all the support to nl (nuevo leon). about five families were outside the casino waiting for information from authorities, local journalist javier estrada reported. gustavo madrazo was one of those waiting outside the casino. he said his wife, martha, and her sister, miriam gonzalez, were inside. authorities have not identified any of the victims. so far, no representative for the company that manages the casino had arrived outside. the mexican army and state and municipal police forces were also on the scene. alejandro poire, mexico's top national security spokesman, said the federal government has made contact with local officials and that calderon has spoken to the governor of nuevo leon to offer support. poire said those who carried out the attacks will be held responsible. they will pay for their crimes. ... we will do absolutely everything ... to restore tranquility. the national commission on human rights in mexico sent a news release saying it has opened an investigation regarding the response to the events at the casino. the priority is to help safeguard the human rights enshrined in the constitution of the united mexican states and international treaties. the commission again makes clear that the insecurity in the country requires public officials responsible for implementing and enforcing the law, carry out preventive actions to protect society and away from any violence. the national commission will monitor the actions taken by the competent authorities to respond adequately to the aggrieved persons. the nhrc says it has also sent personnel to the scene including physicians, psychologists and lawyers to work jointly with authorities. nuevo leon, in northeastern mexico, has seen several grenade attacks so far this year. on august 13, four civilians were wounded when an armed group fired two grenades at a jail in the municipality of apodaca. in july, gunmen entered a downtown bar in monterrey and shot 20 people dead. a public safety spokesman told cnn the attack was likely sparked by a dispute between organized crime groups for control of the el sabino gordo nightclub, where drugs were allegedly sold. nuevo leon and the neighboring states of coahuila and tamaulipas have been the scene of a series of clashes between organized crime groups. the gulf cartel and los zetas are vying for control of trafficking routes into the united states. in november 2010, the federal government launched the coordinated operation northeast, which involves sending more security forces to the area to tackle crime. cnn's nick valencia contributed to this report "

" islamabad, pakistan (cnn) -- the son of slain gov. salman taseer was kidnapped friday afternoon in a wealthy neighborhood in the city of lahore, police said. shahbaz taseer was abducted from his car as he was on the way to his office, senior police official abdul razaq cheema told reporters. lahore police chief ahmad raza tahir, appearing on pakistani television, told reporters that a squad of 16 security personnel had been provided to taseer for protection, as he had earlier reported receiving a series of anonymous threats. however, a provincial minister told reporters that the security detail was not with taseer during the kidnapping. he said four armed men abducted taseer in the gulberg neighborhood, blocking his car with a motorcycle and a four-wheel drive vehicle. taseer ran several family businesses after the death of his father. salman taseer was a renowned businessman and governor of punjab province who was assassinated by one of his own security guards earlier this year. police say bodyguard mumtaz qadri confessed to gunning down taseer because of the governor was critical of the country's blasphemy law. the controversial legislation has been criticized by some as being used to entrap minorities.

" strauss-kahn case: what next for accuser and accused? by laura smith-spark , cnn before his arrest, dominique strauss-kahn was considered a front-runner to enter the race for president of france. story highlights dominique strauss-kahn may seek to rehabilitate his political career in france he still faces a civil lawsuit in new york and a possible attempted rape case in france nafissatou diallo is still thinking about what to do next with her life, a pastor says questions are raised about her status after claims she lied in federal applications (cnn) -- since france's dominique strauss-kahn was arrested in new york three months ago on sexual assault charges, the drama surrounding his case has gripped the united states, france and the world. the case appeared to pit the word of the archetypal powerful white man against that of a poor black woman, in the form of his accuser, hotel maid and immigrant nafissatou diallo. the criminal charges against the former french finance minister were finally dropped tuesday by prosecutors in manhattan, who said they doubted diallo's credibility. but where does that leave both protagonists in this lurid drama, played out on the global media stage? for strauss-kahn, who stepped down as head of the international monetary fund amid the scandal, tuesday's news was a cause for celebration. this is the end of an unjust and terrible test. i'm relieved for my wife, my children, my friends and all those who've supported me, he said. i can hardly wait to return to my country but first i still have a few things to do before being able to leave. i will explain myself more fully once i return. what he will say once he is back in france is not clear -- but his legal troubles are not yet over. strauss-kahn must remain in the united states for at least another 30 days to allow for an appeal against the decision to drop the charges. meanwhile, a civil case filed against him by diallo is still pending. investigators in france are also considering whether to prosecute him for attempted rape over a complaint filed by writer tristane banon, in relation to an alleged incident in paris in 2003. and a lawyer for diallo, thibault de montbrial, opened up a new front in the legal battle tuesday when he filed charges in france accusing a member of strauss-kahn's staff of putting pressure on a woman in the paris suburb of sarcelles not to testify against him in the new york case. aside from the legal issues, strauss-kahn must also overcome the damage done to his reputation if he hopes to recapture his political trajectory. before his arrest, he was considered a front-runner to win the socialist party's nomination to run for president against the incumbent nicolas sarkozy next year. but despite the joy at tuesday's news expressed by some of his fellow party members -- notably martine aubry, who is now seeking the socialist nomination in his place -- observers say he may not find it easy to regain his former status. the political game for strauss-kahn in france is over. all his strongest supporters inside the party know about it, said christian malard, a journalist for broadcaster france 3. now i don't mean he won't have a role -- i'm convinced that behind the scenes, behind the curtain, he will be a kind of godfather, a kind of referee, because it's still remembered by most of the socialist voters, by the electorate, that he is the man who was definitely given as a strong potential winner for the next presidential election, beating sarkozy in all circumstances. although he may retain some backstage influence, his image in the eyes of the broader french public is undoubtedly tarnished. a poll by ipsos-le point published on monday suggested only 28% of people held a favorable view of him. adele smith, the new york correspondent for french newspaper le figaro, says he will also have a hard job winning support for a return to the global stage -- especially from americans. they don't look at sexual relationships in the same way as we do in france, they have a more puritanical psyche, she said. whatever transpired in the sofitel hotel suite in may -- and the truth of that encounter may never be known -- the future for diallo, who lives in the bronx area of new york with her 15-year-old daughter, is uncertain. having decided to give up the anonymity usually accorded to sexual assault accusers by the media, the 32-year-old guinean stepped well and truly into the limelight with interviews last month for newsweek magazine and abc news. this will make it very difficult for her to return to any kind of normal life, said the rev. a.r. bernard, of the brooklyn-based christian cultural center. his new york megachurch, which is attended by diallo's lawyer, kenneth thompson, has publicly backed diallo, a muslim. she appeared there with the pastor last month to address the press after giving up her anonymity. she is thinking through what she will do next, how she will continue her life, bernard told cnn, saying he expected to speak to diallo soon and that she did not yet know if her employers at the hotel would keep her on in light of tuesday's news. she took a big risk to speak out publicly, bernard says, but it was motivated by the belief that the district attorney would eventually drop her case and she would be left with only the stigma of the claims against her. she told a compelling story, he said of diallo. it was not for me to judge -- the only reason i got involved was because i wanted fairness in the case and i felt she should be heard by a jury, and the district attorney shouldn't (be the one to) decide. he sees what has happened in her case as damaging to all women, who may now fear that any past indiscretions will be used to discredit their claims of a crime against them -- and says the need for justice transcends questions of religious affiliation. as for diallo, he said, she has not just physical healing necessary -- because there was medical evidence that she was assaulted -- but she also has a lot of emotional and spiritual healing that has to take place. diallo has not spoken publicly since district attorney cyrus vance's decision, but her lawyer told cnn's don lemon tuesday that she was devastated by it. she has told the truth about what happened in that hotel room, thompson said. she can't understand why manhattan district attorney cyrus vance would abandon her. she and her daughter have been crying through the night. he added: clearly, the d.a. looked at dominique strauss-kahn, his status, his power. if dominique strauss-kahn was a bus driver from the south bronx or a construction worker from harlem or a plumber ... do you think that manhattan district attorney cyrus vance would care what was in miss diallo's asylum application? questions have been raised about diallo's legal status in the united states in light of the claims by prosecutors that she lied on an asylum application and in tax filings. they also said she had claimed she was gang-raped by soldiers in her native country, but later admitted it never happened. defense attorney bruce barket, in new york's garden city, told cnn she appeared to have quite a problem, as the prosecutors' claims that she lied on federal forms could lead to her being prosecuted in manhattan for false statements or perjury. if she lied on her immigration papers, she could also face possible deportation, he said. whether that is pursued may depend on whether the authorities choose to let the whole scandal die down or risk stirring it all up again as she defends her case, he added. meanwhile, lawyers for strauss-kahn say diallo will face an uphill struggle to take forward the civil case against him, filed in the bronx, in the weeks to come. she doesn't have much, if any, chance in a civil case, william taylor told cnn's piers morgan on tuesday night. the same difficulties, the same lies will come back to haunt her in a civil case. smith, for le figaro, said strauss-kahn's lawyers seem to be gearing up for a big fight in the civil case, perhaps seeing that as a chance to restore his image. but she doubts that diallo will be deported if prosecutors' claims that she lied in her asylum application prove to be true, saying the political fallout for the new york authorities would be too great. much has been said to discredit diallo and, at the same time, people are hurting too much as a result of the poor economy to care greatly about others, she said. but there is a little support for diallo's plight among the city's residents. whatever happens, people can't help looking at things through the racial, gender and class frame, she said. they can't help looking at it as a rich white guy who had sex -- forced or not forced -- with a poor black woman from the bronx. for people here, it is outrageous. cnn's atika shubert, don lemon and saskya vandoorne contributed to this report.

" (cnn) -- a global human rights monitoring group urged libya's national transitional council on wednesday to take urgent steps to avoid lawlessness and reprisals against supporters of strongman moammar gadhafi. human rights watch sent letters to mahmoud jibril, the rebel government's prime minister, and mustafa abdul jalil, chairman of the council, asking them oversee a political transition in libya that respects human rights. the national transitional council has set a good tone for the transition with forceful statements about justice and human rights, said sarah leah whitson, middle east and north africa director at human rights watch. but concrete steps are urgently needed to avoid revenge, protect vulnerable people and help promote the rule of law. mansour el-kikhia, a libyan scholar and dissident, said the transitional council is working to minimize revenge killings, though some have already occurred. he cited conversations earlier in the day with ntc members as his source. if you are put in jail by somebody and you were tortured, you're going to remember the person who kidnapped you, he said. it's very difficult to control them. el-kikhia said the council intends to apply the rule of law. human rights watch urged the council to step up security to protect pro-gadhafi libyans, those displaced from rebel-held territories and those accused of serving as mercenaries on behalf of the libyan leader. the organization also asked the council to protect prisons, police stations, courthouses and other government institutions that became symbols of gadhafi's repression and also documents that could be invaluable in proving government accountability in past deeds and abuses. it wants to avoid what happened after the fall of iraq's saddam hussein in 2003, when many government buildings were looted and damaged and documents were destroyed. the letters sent to the council also asked the following: -- treat all detainees humanely and in accordance with international laws. -- cooperate with the international criminal court. -- consider a united nations role in post-war libya. "
" however, they said monday that one of the other two, mohammed gadhafi, had escaped. and saif al-islam gadhafi -- a top adviser to his father -- made an appearance before international journalists early tuesday to refute reports of his arrest. where is libya's leader, and how long can he hold out? there was no immediate comment from ntc officials on saadi gadhafi's status or his offer, made a day after rebel forces overran his father's bab al-aziziya compound and claimed control over nearly all of tripoli. libyan government officials have made several previous cease-fire offers during the course of the six-month revolt against gadhafi's 42-year rule.

" (cnn) -- the african union plans to host a delayed summit thursday to raise funds for famine victims amid mounting criticism over the continent's weak response to the disaster. the meeting originally planned for august 9 was postponed this month even as the organization called on urgent aid to the drought-struck horn of africa region. urgent humanitarian assistance is crucial to alleviate the impact of the drought, which has deprived people from water, sanitation, health, basic food and nutritional needs, the 54-nation body said in a statement announcing the delay. it did not give a reason for postponing the meeting, which will be held at its headquarters in addis ababa, ethiopia. a drought in the horn of africa region straddling ethiopia, kenya and somalia has left nearly 12 million people in need of assistance. somalia is especially badly hit, with a famine declared in some parts of the nation. relief efforts in somalia have been hindered by the ongoing battle between islamist rebels and the transitional government, which holds little sway beyond mogadishu. aid agencies have urged the international community to ramp up help as thousands flee somalia each week in search of food and water -- many walking for days in the sweltering sun to refugee camps in kenya and ethiopia. the meeting comes as aid groups urge the continent's leaders to step up their efforts. the african union has so far pledged only $500,000 for the aid effort, and most key governments have pledged even less or nothing at all, oxfam said in a statement this month. only a handful of african nations have donated to the effort, according to oxfam.

" mother: didn't know 13-year-old daughter was working for zetas from belen zapata , cnnmexico the girl has been released because mexican law says only offenders older than 14 are subject to serving time in jail. story highlights she is not to blame, mother says of girl, who confessed to working for a drug cartel the girl says she said was the only member of her family who was working for the zetas she says she kept track of who came and went in a town in zacatecas mexico city (cnn) -- seated in a room of the attorney general's office in the western mexico state of jalisco, a woman waits to be reunited with her 13-year-old daughter. two weeks before, the girl had run away from home. her mother thought that she was out there with her boyfriend. but the newspaper that a neighbor took her told a different story: the eldest of her six children belonged to the criminal group of drug traffickers, the zetas, and had been detained the previous weekend during a confrontation between police and gunmen. in an interview with cnnmexico, the woman, who asked not to be identified, said she did not know whether her daughter was involved in alleged criminal activities -- although the girl confessed to the contrary. the woman traveled from the nearby state of zacatecas to guadalajara, in jalisco, to see her daughter. the first thing i did, when i found out, was try to support my daughter, come for her, to show that she is not guilty of anything, because she is a girl, the woman said. we all feel very bad over the news, but we know that she is not to blame, she is a girl incapable of doing so much. in a statement before the public prosecutor and later before reporters, the girl said she had spent a month working for organized crime. she said that her work -- which paid some $800 for the month -- consisted of keeping track of who entered and left luis moya, a community of about 10,000 residents located in the south of zacatecas in central mexico. the girl said that she reported to a 22-year-old woman known as la chaparra, who has since been arrested by state and federal police. guarded by two police officers, each nearly twice her height, the teenager -- wearing jeans and a sweatshirt -- was taken before reporters. before her sat a table laden with the arsenal allegedly seized in the operation during which she was arrested. her parents were not there. the reporters questioned her: what cartel were you working for? for the zetas. does your family know this? yes. what did they tell you? that i should leave. how much were they paying you? 4,000 (pesos) every two weeks. since when? since a month ago. how did you enter? by necessity. the girl said that her mother had introduced her to la chaparra. nevertheless, she said that she was the only member of her family who was working for the zetas. the girl was taken to the facilities of the jalisco delegation of the attorney general's office, where she remained for three days before being released because the law of integral justice for adolescents of the state of jalisco stipulates that only offenders older than 14 are subject to serving time in jail. the alleged youthful member of the zetas was taken before the first court of minors of jalisco, who must establish the conditions for her rehabilitation. but she will be able to work toward her rehabilitation at home, under the vigilance of her mother and tutor. as the only person responsible for her family, the mother said she works 12 hours per day in activities that she prefers not to divulge. she said her schedule had kept her from keeping track of what her daughter is doing after the school day has ended. the woman said she knows that her daughter skipped her high school classes a few times and had been expelled due to what the school called rebellious conduct. but she said her daughter had vowed afterward to improve, and has gotten good grades -- good enough to be awarded a scholarship by the mexican government. she's a very intelligent girl, but -- as with all children her age -- a little rebellious, a little restless, but she is a very good girl, the mother said. from now on, the mother added, she will be more aware of what her daughter is doing, and she will help with her daughter's rehabiliation. the employment of children by mexican cartels is no longer a novelty in the country. eduardo guerrero gutierrez, consultant and security analyst, said that such criminal groups recruit principally young people. the youths are not contracted directly by the cartel, rather by groups that work for them, who recruit, train, pay and -- if they show potential -- incorporate them in jobs of greater responsibility to convert them into assassins, he said. last month, in the state of morelos, a 14-year-old boy was sentenced to three years in a mexican prison and a fine of 4.5 million pesos (about $400,000) for crimes that included homicide, possession of a weapon, kidnapping and organized crime. witnesses testified that the boy had tortured and decapitated four men. linked to the south pacific cartel, the boy said he had joined organized crime at age 11. the teenager's age -- and his on-camera description of the slayings -- brought international attention to the case. analysts said the dramatic example showed how mexican drug gangs were increasingly recruiting youths. in mexico, minors who have committed serious crimes receive lighter sentences than those imposed on adults. some critics believe that, to dissuade minors from engaging in criminal activity, the law ought to lower the age of criminal responsibility from 18 to 16.

" tuscany was one of the hardest-hit regions, as german troops retreated north following the liberation of rome. fulvetti estimates 3,650 people died there, the majority in june 1944. the war on civilians was triggered by benito mussolini's downfall in july 1943 when the fascist dictator was arrested, paving the way for italy's armistice with the allies. tens of thousands of italian soldiers who had fought under mussolini then took up arms to fight nazi germany. in march 1944, partisans in rome attacked a column of ss police officers, killing 33 germans. on orders from german high command, 335 men and boys were rounded up and executed at the ardeatine caves, near rome. the reprisal killings set the stage for how germany would conduct the remainder of the war in italy. troops were ordered to retaliate against civilians as punishment for partisan actions, fulvetti said. any form of resistance by civilians was cause for punishment, even simply refusing to shelter or feed german troops. clashes between local resistance and german troops near san pancrazio spread fear of reprisals throughout the countryside. they came on june 29, when units of the notorious hermann goering division stormed into homes and rounded up villagers in the town square. goffredo cinelli, who had served in italy's air force before mussolini's ouster, hid in the attic, as his father was led away. i heard the women and children crying, he said. my mother later said she went to speak to my father. a soldier turned her back and told her they were taking him to be tortured. she and my father both cried. the men's actual fate soon became clear. inside the cellar of a farmhouse, the local priest pleaded for his parishioners' lives. after saying mass, he was the first to die by gunfire at close range. the others were similarly executed. the germans later set fire to the corpses, and to villagers' homes. that same day, 173 people were killed in the nearby villages of cornia and civitella. gabriella panzieri lost several family members in the san pancrazio massacre. six years old at the time, she describes taking refuge in the woods with her mother. i remember the flames rising from our village that night. it was like the whole world was on fire, she said. allied troops reached san pancrazio, by then reduced to rubble, two weeks later. after the war, in 1946, a military court sentenced a former ss commander to life in prison for the ardeatine caves massacre. but plans for further trials were soon shelved. the approaching cold war dampened enthusiasm for ferreting out nazi war criminals. there was a growing reluctance to embarrass germany, said dr. paolo pezzino, who teaches contemporary history at the university of pisa. international justice took a back seat to realpolitik. the communists were now the enemy. it was no longer the case to look back at the past but to face the future. silence reigned for half a century. then, in 1994, a startling discovery was made at the military tribunal in rome. a forgotten archive revealed a treasure trove of evidence on hundreds of wartime atrocities, documented by allied and italian investigators. pezzino served as consultant to a parliamentary commission that looked into the motives behind the files' concealment. he maintains that if they had been properly forwarded to the military courts immediately after the war, more war crime trials could have resulted. this was a cover-up in every sense of the word, he added. the discovery of the so-called cabinet of shame triggered public outcry -- and a renewed call for justice. i felt i had a moral obligation to provide answers, said marco de paolis, currently italy's chief military prosecutor, who played a key role in reopening war crime cases. and to bring a sense of justice to hundreds of people who had been waiting over 50 years. since 2002, de paolis has tried more than a dozen cases, several resulting in convictions. by 2007, all but one defendant accused in the san pancrazio massacre had died. max josef milde, 82 when the trial started, was tried in absentia, convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the shooting deaths of 203 of the men, women and children in san pancrazio, civitella and cornia. when the sentence was pronounced, i felt the cry of justice, recalled mayor sauro testi, who accompanied survivors and family members to the sentencing. the state had finally responded. milde has always maintained his innocence, and has not shown up to serve his sentence. while german authorities helped with the case, germany does not extradite its citizens convicted of war crimes in other countries. still, his conviction was welcomed by many victims' families. it was an historic moment in which someone was declared guilty, says michele panzieri, who lost several family members to the tragedy. it's important to never forget, but you have to forgive in the end. cinelli, now 92, the air force veteran whose father was killed in the massacre, had a different reaction. i knew nothing would be resolved in the end. after 60 years? he shrugged. it was a time when there was enormous hate between those who were fascist and those who weren't. it was a tremendous struggle. even after the conviction, san pancrazio refuses to forget its past. every year, villagers hold a candlelight procession on the anniversary of the tragedy, to remember the victims. read no hate at memorial michele panzieri's father, enzo, is president of a local association dedicated to preserving the memory of the tragedy. he was an infant when the front swept through tuscany and took with it the father he never knew. on a recent afternoon, he could be seen talking to a group of students inside the farmhouse cellar -- now a museum -- answering their questions with restrained candor and insight. i enjoy talking to the kids and sometimes i've seen them get emotional, panzieri said. the youth of today will lead italy tomorrow. they need to see these things so they're never repeated.

" london (cnn) -- british health authorities on friday urged vigilance after packages of an over-the-counter painkiller were found to contain antipsychotic drugs. the antipsychotic seroquel xl was inside packets of the painkiller nurofen plus, the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency warned. three defective packets have been found so far, all in pharmacies in south london, but more than 16,000 more could potentially be affected, the agency said. each packet contains 32 tablets. nurofen plus, made by reckitt benckiser, can be bought without a prescription and has silver and black packaging. it is used for short-term relief of acute pain and contains codeine. the seroquel xl 50mg tablets, manufactured by astrazeneca, are prescription only and used to treat such illnesses as schizophrenia, mania and bipolar depression. two people are known to have taken seroquel xl tablets from one of the affected nurofen plus packets, a spokeswoman for reckitt benckiser said. in the other two cases, people noticed the boxes contained seroquel xl before taking any tablets, she added. a spokesman for the regulatory agency told cnn it could not rule out sabotage, but at the moment believed it was an issue to do with the packaging of drugs by wholesalers rather than a manufacturing problem. we haven't ruled out sabotage as of yet, but the investigation is still at an early stage, he said. common side effects of seroquel xl include dizziness, headaches and weight gain, he said. reckitt benckiser, the maker of nurofen plus, said it was taking the issue very seriously. it appears that all the standard blister strips of nurofen plus tablets have been removed and replaced with foil sealed blister strips of seroquel xl, said a statement from the company issued by public relations firm virgo health. nurofen plus and seroquel xl are not manufactured or packaged by the same company, or in the same factory, and therefore serious investigations are currently under way to establish the source of the problem, the statement said. after careful review of the manufacturing system, manufacturing errors by the makers of nurofen plus or seroquel xl are not thought to be part of the cause at this stage. astrazeneca, the maker of seroquel xl, also ruled out manufacturing errors and said it was working with the mhra and reckitt benckiser to find out what happened. patient safety is our primary concern and we are taking this issue seriously, astrazeneca said in a statement. the regulatory agency urged those who have bought nurofen plus to check the packaging of tablets within the box carefully. anyone who has taken a tablet and has questions should consult their physician, the drug regulatory body's statement said. three batches of nurofen plus are affected by the alert, the mhra said. they are batch numbers 13jj, expiry date 03/2014; 57jj, expiry date 05/2014; and 49jj, expiry date 05/2014. cnn's laura smith-spark contributed to this report.

" it is not clear who the victims were. were they among the 1,600 civilians or 370 security forces slain in the unrest? the posting on the video says the bodies are anti-government forces being dumped by thugs loyal to president bashar al-assad. syrian state tv has aired the video, saying that the bodies are being dumped by anti-government protesters. a banner said the incident took place in hama over the orontes river. razan zaitouneh, a syrian activist, said activists doubt the incident could have happened at the hama location because the river is dry at this time of year. but one prominent anti-government activist, who asked not to be named because of the dangers that could arise from the release of the information, told cnn the state tv account was correct. the bodies are those of syrian secret police killed by syrian fighters from iraq who have joined the anti-government fight, said the activist, who gets information about the goings-on in syria from an extensive network of informants. that same activist stressed that the antagonists are not representative of the protest movement. violent fringe elements have appeared during the syrian tumult. one study last month from the international crisis group said some anti-government elements have taken up arms. however, that report said, the vast majority of casualties have been peaceful protesters, and the vast majority of the violence has been perpetrated by the security services. the activist said the emergence of this video is a double-edged sword for protesters. on the one hand, the peaceful demonstrators need to become aware of the existence of fringe elements, he said. this would encourage more people to reject both the regime and these types of attacks and maintain the aims of peaceful protest, he said. at the same time, he added, the incident gives credence to the syrian government's assertion that it is targeting armed gangs. such violence, he said, could cause the international community to hesitate in continuing its mounting pressure against the syrian regime.

" the national transitional council, the rebel leadership, says it is determined to flush him out with minimal civilian losses. we don't want to spill a lot of blood, you know, because they are our brothers, one rebel fighter said. at a nearby intersection, a dozen bodies lay in the sun, some of them with their hands bound. rebel fighters say the men were executed by gadhafi's retreating forces. but the bodies appear to be those of black africans, who made up a large portion of the pro-gadhafi forces, raising questions about whether the men may have been executed by the rebels. to the south of the compound, which is located near tripoli's mediterranean shore, fighting between rebel fighters and gadhafi loyalists persisted. snipers and mortar shells continued to inflict casualties on hundreds of civilians, said kirstie campbell, a worker for the international medical corps in tripoli. i've worked in war zones for 10 years, but this is pretty bad, she said. cnn's dan rivers and thomas evans contributed to this report.
