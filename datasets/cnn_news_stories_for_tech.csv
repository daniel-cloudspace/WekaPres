" opensuse, which makes another linux desktop platform, and others have been choked by microsoft's strong monopoly on the desktop, said alan clark, an opensuse director. it's played out differently than i expected, to be honest, clark said. we made some progress, but nothing like anybody envisioned. yet, opensuse has a comfortable presence in the server market, clark said. linux is very much pervasive. it's everywhere. you can't even fly on an airplane; ... you can't use facebook; you can't buy a book from amazon, clark said, without running into linux. the cult of linux familiarity with linux became a crucial skill for budding software engineers and server caretakers as far back as the mid-1990s. when david bohnett sought a partner in his new web venture called geocities, resulting in one of the largest internet business deals ever when it went public and then was acquired by yahoo for $3.6 billion in 1999, his main criteria was an adeptness with linux programming, bohnett said in an interview. john rezner fit the description and shared in the pair's eventual fortune. torvalds, the brain behind linux, never seemed very interested in fortunes, according to people who know him. the reclusive programming wizard declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed by phone, though he talked openly through e-mail and appeared on stage last week at linuxcon in vancouver, canada. there, torvalds was treated like a celebrity. a lover of reclusive scientists, including sir isaac newton and albert einstein, he described the general reactions from linux fans as just odd. he wrote: sometimes it does get to be a bit overwhelming. clark, from opensuse, described a memorable meeting with torvalds. the first time he came to japan, seriously, it was like a rock star arrived, and i could kind of tell it was really overwhelming for him, clark said. he took it in stride. the linux faithful are predominantly male, often nerdy, with strong principles about collaborative development that translate to a belief in a less hierarchal, more cooperative society, according to interviews. for example, ubuntu's bacon has an android phone, which uses google's open-source software, because the ethical side of me feels like it's the right thing to do, he said. it's not just a product. it's an ethos. apple has tried to define its principles in advertising: artistic, noncorporate and able to think different. its brand has been adopted by millions of people. meanwhile, linux has maintained a devout but small following over the last two decades. the linux software is embedded in many millions of machines, but its ethos and the penguin logo that embodies it remain an underground movement. to let turk explain it, because he'd be more than happy to, his tattoo is like a secret handshake, waiting for someone to be able to recognize and reciprocate. every so often, at the gym or something, i'll run into someone who's like, 'that's the linux tattoo,' and there's a conversation, said turk, who now works for open-source software maker talend. it's always been something that the community feels like it owns. it's almost a little bit anti-establishment. the penguin doesn't stand a chance against the marketing of big firms. but that's great. it's good. it's ours.

" the beauty of mclaren's system is that it reduces the complexity of a racetrack into a circle so at the point of decision, presentation of the data is very simple, which allows the engineer in a very stressful environment to make the right strategic decision and also see the data in a very clear, crisp format, said tomlinson. for the last three years nats has been working with mclaren's engineers to map heathrow's taxiways and runways -- much as they do a formula one track. but now, says tomlinson, in place of a race strategist the system is operated by heathrow's air traffic control, and instead of a circle the airport's network of runways and taxi lanes are represented by a simple rectangle -- enabling planes to be guided around the airport with greater ease and accuracy once they've landed. the collaboration has been groundbreaking according to geoff mcgrath, managing director of mclaren applied technologies -- the f1 team's tech division. to my knowledge this is a first -- nats has invested in this because there is nothing like it available, he added. the system is now in its proof of concept stage and hopes are high that it will be used by airports around the world within a year. think in terms of the environmental benefits of that, enthused tomlinson. large airports with about 1300 to 1400 flights a day - if you save just one minute of taxi time per flight on average, that equates to one day's worth of taxi time - and that's how much we could save using mclaren's technology.

" timeline: steve jobs' career "
" (cnn) -- twitter's co-founders announced this week that they are throwing their money and support behind a new app called lift, which, according to a blog post that sounds like it was written by lost's dharma initiative, is an interesting new application for unlocking human potential through positive reinforcement. we love this software for what it does, and because we've tried it and it works. our plan is to build something extraordinary together, the post says. right. well. but what is lift, exactly? and what makes it so awesome that every tech blog on the planet is writing about it despite the fact the app is in alpha testing and isn't open to pretty much anyone. perhaps it's the fact that evan williams and biz stone , author of tuesday's aforementioned welcome-to-the-future announcement, are such rock stars in the tech world. this is the first investment for the obvious corporation (yes, that's the real name), which the twitter alums started this year. obvious' goal, as stated on its website -- which, obviously, is obvious.com -- is to make systems that help people work together to improve the world. the partnership between obvious and lift is more interesting than the scant details about the app itself, writes pascal-emmanuel gobry at the blog the silicon alley insider. readwriteweb, a tech blog, offers some analysis about what the new lift app may look like. in a word? it's like twitter. it sounds like twitter in its simplicity and from what i've seen it looks a lot like twitter too -- but with more structure, marshall kirkpatrick writes in a post on that site. what's called lift today was apparently called mibbles just weeks ago and was described then as 'a very simple tracking and encouragement tool.' williams and stone are funding lift, but the app's creators are jon crosby and tony stubblebine, who are also big names in the tech world. in a blog post called uplifting news about an obvious partnership , stubblebine writes that he and crosby do have a prototype of the app, but we're a long way from opening the doors to the public. our intention is to create a long-lived company. but unlike my last company, we're not set on doing this alone. enter obvious, he writes. techcrunch, another tech blog, did some digging in the code of the lift website and found a humorous clue about the app's future. hidden in the code is this statement: lift. achieve anything (assuming we finish building this app). robin wauters, the post's author, gives lift the benefit of the doubt: i assume they will (finish the app), he writes. can't wait to finally be able to achieve anything!

" jobs famously dropped out of oregon's reed college. but he later would say that a class he audited in calligraphy inspired apple's design aesthetic. he was booted from apple in 1985. but, while away from the company, he founded a company called next that developed an early version of what would become the revolutionary macintosh computer operating system. jobs chewed on these points during a speech in 2005. you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future, he said in a commencement address at stanford university. you have to trust in something -- your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. this approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life. all this adds up to people seeing jobs as an inspiration. it is truly the end of an era. thank you for inspiring us all steve, dave morin, founder of an app called path and a former apple and facebook employee, wrote on his google plus page on thursday morning. you've shown an entire generation what is possible with innovation, design, and focus. that kind of impact makes it difficult for anyone else to bring so much history and charisma to the company. in the short time since jobs' resignation, tech pundits have been writing that the first era of personal computing is over, since bill gates from microsoft and jobs are no longer in the business. there's much praise online for the new ceo of apple, tim cook, who has been the company's coo, essentially running it since jobs went on medical leave in january. a lot of attention is paid, in particular, to his business sense. at the atlantic, nicholas jackson writes that picking cook as the next ceo of apple is steve jobs' greatest creation . tim cook is not steve jobs, he writes. but he did learn from the best how to emulate him. and if he was going to fail, he already would have. cook has been acting ceo of apple since january, when jobs went on his third medical leave from the company. yes, it was that long ago. he presided over the latest mac refresh, over the launch of the ipad 2, over the announcement of the icloud, and even over that moment, about two weeks ago, when apple's market cap exceeded that of oil-services giant exxon, making it number one. but no one is arguing that cook will bring as much life to the tech world. fortune's miguel heft writes : like jobs, cook is a relentless executive and exacting boss, a perfectionist who obsesses over minute details. but the similarities between the two men end there. while jobs is a charismatic leader known for outbursts of temper, cook, who was raised in a small town in alabama, is soft-spoken, reserved and intensely private. and as jobs used his creative genius and vision to conceive and design blockbuster products like the imac, iphone and ipad, cook's considerable operational skills were focused on making sure that apple could build millions of those products and deliver them to every corner of the world to meet customers' seemingly insatiable demand. the washington post says it's unlikely (cook will) match the innovative momentum of his predecessor. finally, apple's product announcements -- which are treated like rock concerts by the plaid-shirt-and-big-glasses-wearing tech bloggers who get to attend them -- will be far less theatrical without jobs' presence. critics often talk disparagingly of the 'reality distortion field' generated by the apple boss: his ability to convince onlookers that technologies that would seem unformed in other hands have reached a peak of perfection at apple, the financial times wrote . generating this suspension of disbelief is essential to stirring up demand for gadgets most consumers had no idea they needed, and is an art form of which mr. jobs has long been the acknowledged master . cook's commencement address at auburn university last year gives some hints about his presentation skills. during the talk, a robe-wearing cook discussed his decision to come to apple at a time when the company was doing far worse than competitors. not only was compaq performing much better than apple, it was headquartered in texas, and therefore closer to auburn football, he said, trying to appeal to the presumably football-crazed audience. the response to his joke? an un-steve-jobs-like silence.

" the boxy beige macintosh sold well, but jobs clashed frequently with colleagues, and in 1986, he was ousted from apple after a power struggle. then came an 10-year hiatus during which he had high-profile successes (buying pixar animation studios from george lucas before they made it big with toy story ) and failures (founding next computer, whose pricey, cube-shaped computer workstations never caught on). in 1996 apple bought next, returning jobs to the then-struggling company he had co-founded. within a year, he was running apple again -- older and perhaps wiser but no less of a perfectionist. and four years after that, he took the stage to introduce the original ipod, the little white device that revolutionized portable music and kick-started apple's furious comeback. internet mourns jobs' resignation | ireport: share your thoughts i'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if i hadn't been fired from apple, he said at stanford in 2005. it was awful-tasting medicine, but i guess the patient needed it. sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. when it comes to apple, you pretty much know the rest. over the next decade, jobs wowed launch-event audiences, and consumers, with one game-changing hit after another: itunes (2003). the macbook (2006). the iphone (2007). the ipad (2010). observers marveled at his skills as a pitchman, his ability to inspire god-like devotion among apple fanboys (and scorn from pc fans) and his one more thing surprise announcements. time after time, he sold people on a product they didn't know they needed until he invented it. and all this on an official annual salary of $1. by the mid-2000s, however, jobs was having serious health problems. in 2004, he announced to his employees that he was being treated for pancreatic cancer. he lost weight and appeared unusually gaunt at keynote speeches to apple developers, spurring concerns about his health and fluctuations in apple's stock price. one wire service even accidentally published jobs' obituary. jobs, 56, who is married with four children, had a liver transplant in 2009 during a six-month medical leave of absence from apple. he took another medical leave in january this year. because of this, some observers said they weren't surprised by wednesday's news that jobs was stepping down as apple's ceo. read jobs' resignation letter there is a certain sort of sad inevitability to this moment, the times' nocera told cnn, adding that jobs wouldn't give up control of his company easily. apple is his life. he cares about it almost as much as he cares about his wife and children. according to the wall street journal, jobs once famously said, it's more fun to be a pirate than to join the navy. he even flew a pirate flag over his engineers' building while they were building the macintosh. but the reality is his once-renegade tech company, the david to microsoft's goliath, is long been part of the mainstream. apple has more than $70 billion in cash reserves and even briefly surpassed exxon mobil this month as the world's most valuable company. jobs doesn't give many interviews, especially about his personal life, and apple has been tight-lipped about his health. but perhaps mindful of his legacy, he has cooperated on his first authorized biography, scheduled to be published by simon schuster in november. i've done a lot of things i'm not proud of, such as getting my girlfriend pregnant when i was 23 and the way i handled that, jobs is quoted as saying in the promotional material for the book, being penned by walter isaacson. but i don't have any skeletons in my closet that can't be allowed out. by contrast, jobs has always spoken with immense pride about what he and his engineers have accomplished at apple. your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. and the only way to do great work is to love what you do, he told the stanford grads. if you haven't found it yet, keep looking. don't settle. as with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. and, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. "
" those who follow apple know that cook has been an active contributor to apple's success in his role as chief operating officer. he has been credited with aggressively working to lower apple's hardware and gadget prices, and making deals with component suppliers in order to give apple an upper hand in the market. gamestop responds to deus ex controversy by pulling it from shelves in person, cook is gruff and assertive, but in a way that makes people feel secure -- this is no doubt part of the reason why apple has slowly been introducing cook to the public via apple keynotes over the last few years. in the public's eye, cook has become the riker to jobs' picard -- and people generally like riker. there may be no way to truly replace steve jobs, but apple knows that publicly supporting tim cook is, at the very least, good pr. copyright 2010 arstechnica.com "
" he then announces that he'll be introducing three revolutionary products of this class. the first one: a widescreen ipod with touch controls. second, a revolutionary mobile phone. the third, a breakthrough internet communications device. then, he grins as the icons for the three devices beginning spinning on the giant screen behind him until they nearly blur into one. are you getting it? jobs said. these are not three separate devices. this is one device. and we are calling it iphone. watch jobs' presentation unveiling the iphone in 2007. 2. welcome to the apple store the so-called experts thought a store that sold only one company's products was a bad idea. jobs, of course, disagreed. in a 2001 video shown to apple developers, ceo jobs strolls through the as-yet-unopened store in tyson's corner, virginia, that would be the first of more than 300 apple stores worldwide . jobs strolls around, showcasing then-novel features such as the genius bar and nooks for children's activities. with nary an ipod or iphone in sight (the ipod was launched in october that year, with the iphone following in 2007), jobs introduced the concept that the stores would be more than just retail space. literally half the store is devoted to solutions, jobs says in the video. because people don't just want to buy personal computers any more. they want to know what they can do with them. watch jobs' tour of the first apple store 3. the 'magical ipad' it was easy to mock the starry-eyed enthusiasm jobs displayed in january of last year when he unveiled a tablet computer called the ipad. extraordinary. gorgeous. unbelievably great. a dream. it's so much more intimate than a laptop, he said. this won't be a purchase, he suggested. this will be a relationship. of course, all the gadget went on to do was absolutely dominate the emerging tablet market. by some accounts, the ipad now holds about 90% of the tablet market. watch jobs give the ipad keynote presentation on january 27, 2010. or if you prefer, watch this edit that splices together all of the superlatives jobs and others used that day . 4. graduation jobs' 2005 commencement speech at stanford university was the rare instance when his public and private personas collided. it was rare enough for jobs to accept a public-speaking engagement. more surprising by half was that he used it to share some of the most personal details of his life. he began by stoking the flames on one of the famous details of his story -- that he was in the process of becoming one of the world's most famous college dropouts. this is the closest i've ever gotten to a college graduation, he laughed. he then goes on to talk about being given up for adoption when he was born, of leaving school in part because of the cost to his adoptive parents, and of dropping in on classes for a year-and-a-half after that. he later frankly discusses his diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and musings on death. your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life, he said. watch jobs' commencement speech. 5. tablet computers? what are those? this is one that's only fully appreciated as a performance in retrospect. at the all things d digital conference in 2007, a meeting of the tech titans happened when jobs and microsoft's bill gates sat down together for an interview. gates reveals that he carries a tablet computer around with him all the time. he calls the then-nascent gadgets the future of computing. i think you'll have a full-screen device that you carry around and you'll do dramatically more reading off of that, says gates. i believe in the tablet form factor ... and then you'll have the device that fits in your pocket. this was, of course, more than two years before apple's ipad would be unveiled, but it's hard to imagine jobs and company didn't already have it in the works. the first time the word tablet is mentioned, jobs swivels in his chair and appears to literally bite his lip. the first words jobs says about the future of computers? the pc has proved to be very resilient. he eventually allows that post-pc devices are part of the future. but his poker face is fun to watch with hindsight. watch part of the interview with jobs and gates "
" (cnn) -- a 19-year-old who is probably the world's most noted iphone hacker said thursday he's been hired by apple, the very company whose products he's been hacking into. it's been really, really fun, but it's also been a while and i've been getting bored, nicholas allegra, who's better known by his pseudonym comex, posted on twitter . so, the week after next i will be starting an internship with apple. apple did not immediately respond to a cnn request for comment on comex's internship at the company. forbes writer andy greenberg revealed comex's identity this month, calling him the iphone uber-hacker who keeps outsmarting apple. in the story, he noted that comex was looking for an internship, and he suggested that apple give him one. now it has, he wrote friday . comex started the website jailbreakme, which lets iphone users jailbreak their phones simply by visiting that site. a jailbroken iphone can run apps that are not approved by apple for sale in its app store. the phones also can then be unlocked, which makes it possible to use them on wireless networks that apple hasn't approved. international travelers like that feature. other apple hackers have praised the site as being incredibly sophisticated. dino dai zovi told forbes that comex's work is as impressive as stuxnet, a computer worm that apparently targeted iran's nuclear facilities last year. it's fairly common -- more so than you might expect, at least -- for big tech companies to hire once-nefarious hackers. these coding gurus are sometimes better versed in the security vulnerabilities of a company's products than anyone else in the industry. and, these companies hope, the former hackers could use these skills to make their products safer. the blog macrumors says apple has made similar hires in the past: earlier this year mobilenotifier developer peter hajas was picked up as an apple summer intern. venturebeat, however, says that's a new phenomenon for the world's largest tech company: hiring hackers isn't new in the tech world, but it's a fairly recent development for apple, which has usually tried to squash hackers by more traditional means. greenberg, at forbes, says these hires don't always go well: george hotz, one of the first iphone hackers, was sued by sony after reverse engineering the playstation 3, a move that set off a wave of user anger at the company, resulting in more than 20 retaliatory hacking attacks by the hacker collective anonymous and others. but he argues the comex hire may be good for apple: apple, by taking the carrot instead of stick approach, has saved itself that massive pr headache. and by hiring someone who actually understands its products' security weaknesses, it may just be making its users safer, too.

" (cnn) -- for east coast residents keeping a worried eye on hurricane irene, there's a host of mobile apps, twitter feeds and other digital tools available to help. here are a few of them, including suggestions for how to stay plugged in if weather knocks out power in your area. hurricanehd ($3.99 in apple store) hurricanehd provides exclusive video, blog posts from weather experts and other tools for folks watching irene and other future storms. it has a tracking map that can display multiple storms at the same time, sends active storm bulletins and contains an archive of information about past hurricanes. it can also use gps to tell you how far away you are from various points of a nearing storm. weather channel (free for apple and android devices) both the android and apple versions feature animated radar, video, local forecasts and the ability to upload photos and videos of local weather. weather channel max , free for the ipad, adds full-screen, customizable weather maps, in-motion radar and real-time twitter feeds from weather channel meteorologists. hurricane hound ($1.99, android) based on google maps, hurricane hound tracks storms in the atlantic and east pacific, as well as passing along national weather service advisories and warnings. stormpulse stormpulse is a website that uses date from the national hurricane center, cloud imagery from the nerc satellite station and basic imagery from nasa. users can click back and forth to show radar, cloud cover, watches and warnings and other features on a real-time map. twitter feeds in the face of emergency situations, the fast-paced, minute-by-minute updates you can get from twitter are handy. whether you're a twitter user or not, you can pull up and read individual feeds as long as you have web access. the ocean service from noaa, the federal government's science agency for oceans and coasts, has a twitter feed to follow. noaa also runs @stormprediction -- a feed specifically tailored toward sharing severe weather alerts. and fema has a feed to share preparation tips and news about emergency response efforts. of course, we're also inclined to suggest you follow cnn's huge team of folks following the storm. here is a curated list of twitter accounts for the cnn team dedicated to irene. staying powered assuming mobile networks are up and running, folks in areas hit by a storm like irene could be affected anyway by persisting power outages. to stay plugged-in, it will be important to have a power source to recharge your mobile devices that doesn't depend on plugging into the wall or desktop. the gadget reviewers at cnet are fans of the solio universal and cps cellboost chargers. battery companies like energizer offer multiple chargers, and the store where you bought your phone (or tablet) very likely sells batter-powered or solar chargers from the phone-maker or a third party. the axis is a multi-purpose device sanctioned by the american red cross. in addition to a usb charger for mobile phones and other devices, the $70, hand-crank-powered device has an am/fm/noaa radio and flashlight. think of it as the techie swiss army knife for power-out disasters. a couple of things to keep in mind: solar chargers will need sunlight, so will probably be more useful in the aftermath of a storm than during the heart of it. and, obviously, battery-powered models are most handy with a backup supply of dry batteries. know any tools we've missed? feel free to share them in the comments, or send us a message on the @cnntech twitter feed.

" the main change is moving most of your controls from a settings page to being inline, right next to the posts, photos and tags they affect. plus there are several other updates here that will make it easier to understand who can see your stuff (or your friends') in any context. an example will help make sense of all this social-media-speak. say you want to post a photo from a friend's recent birthday party -- and you only want your good friends to be able to see it. before, you would need to go to facebook's edit friends page. then you'd need to set up a list of your facebook friends who you consider to be good friends. that can take a while. then you assign certain properties to that group, allowing them to see photos or status updates or wall posts made by other friends etc. instead of deciding which pieces of content these people will see, you choose the category. confusing much? after the change, facebook users decide who gets to see a photo right as they post it. right next to the post button on facebook, which users click to post something new to the site, there's a little lock icon. click on that and you can choose where to send that post. click customize to get the most control. google plus is similar, but it uses friend circles instead of lists. in comments on facebook's blog post about the privacy change, some users said they were impressed: well done, slowly getting better, one wrote. many, however, referenced google's new-ish social network. glad to see that competition is finally forcing facebook to improve, one person wrote. looks like, fb is transforming to g+... wrote another. and there were more than a few jokes in the comments, too: hahahaha... if you want this functionality, and want it to actually work, just use google+! tech pundit robert scoble chimed in , too: it effectively will keep people from moving to google+ because it takes away many of the advantages of google+ circles. there were some other facebook privacy changes, too. among them: -- users now can approve photo tags before they go onto their news feeds, where friends would see them. before, friends could identify you in a photo without your knowledge and post that on the network. -- a button called view profile as... now appears in the top right corner of facebook profiles. click it and then enter a name of a friend or co-worker to see what your profile looks like when they view it. -- users can change the visibility of a post after it's up. -- facebook now says public instead of everyone in its privacy-setting lingo. both terms mean everyone on the public internet -- not just friends or other facebook users -- can see that piece of content. what do you think of these changes? let us know in the comments.

" i'm currently working as a receptionist at a dentist's office, but when i'm not answering all those phones, i really enjoy kicking back with some lilian jackson braun (that cat is so smart, solving all those mysteries). oh! did i mention i majored in life sciences in college and lost my virginity at age 27? anyway, tell me about you! why no one wants you: well, what else is there to find out? we kind of feel like we've already dated you, and we were bored the first time around. you wouldn't sit down at a bar and tell someone your life story (that role is reserved for the old and deranged), so choose something you and the dude have in common and start with that. there's plenty of time later to run out of things to say. 3). the eccentric example: holy cheezburgers! you sure are a purty lady! i would love to take you down to the playground and push you on the swings! and then we can go to the zoo! or to the ocean to build a giant sand castle by the sea! i'll stomp on it and you'll be pissed, but you'll get over it because i'm just so gosh-darned charming. (i'll also be wearing a rather irresistible bow tie -- with a motor!) write me back, sweet child o' mine -- that sure would be fine (that rhymed!). why no one wants you: we are afraid you will murder us in our sleep. hey, it's great that you're a nonconformist who has his own trained tarantula circus, and any girl who's into well-behaved bugs is sure to dig you, but trying too hard to be interesting is just that: trying too hard. 4). the robot example: hi! i came across your profile and it intrigued me. i'm looking for a smart man with passion and drive, and you seem to be it! want to get a drink sometime? why no one wants you: you probably sent the same message to half of okcupid ... and match.com ... and eharmony ... and jdate. yeah, dating is a numbers game and whatnot, but no one wants to be number 1,000. take, say, three minutes to pound out a more personal message. as we have already established (see #2), we don't need your life story. 5). the creeper example: i want to ****** ***** with your **** ******. and then ***** **** all night long. oh, here's a picture of my junk. why no one wants you: we'll let you know after we examine that snapshot. kidding (maybe). you know that section where the girl/guy has indicated what s/he's looking for ? unless casual sex is listed, cease and desist with the sexting. 6). the gusher example: oh my, you are extremely handsome, you know that? like, you look like a movie star! and you like all of my favorite books! the da vinci code! it changed my life! i'm sure you're way too awesome to ever go for a girl like me, but, wow, man, i hope you deign to answer this lowly message because your eyes are like starshine. why no one wants you: kindly detach yourself from my leg. according to an okcupid study , calling someone sexy, beautiful or hot is a huge turnoff in a first message. if you ever want to stare into those starshine eyes in person, hold the compliments until you're trying to get into said person's pants. 7). the wordless wonder example: you have been added to patrickbatemanistheman's favorite's list! why no one wants you: this is the grown-up equivalent of asking your friend's friend to ask me if i like you -- but, you know, not so grown-up. man up and say something, while avoiding numbers 1 through 6, that is.

" apple has not released any new information about the state of jobs' health. the 56-year-old went on medical leave in january, and he has suffered serious health problems in recent years, including pancreatic cancer and a reported liver transplant. jobs also took a somber tone in his resignation letter: i have always said if there ever came a day when i could no longer meet my duties and expectations as apple's ceo, i would be the first to let you know, he wrote in a letter to apple's board and the apple community at large. unfortunately, that day has come. in the immediate moments after the announcement, tech pundits seemed far more concerned with the state of jobs' health than the future of the company that relies on him as its creative core. apple is credited with kicking off the personal computing revolution. it also ushered in the smartphone craze after it released the iphone in 2007 and rocked the digital music industry with itunes. the tech blog gizmodo wrote a short tribute to jobs: we very, very much hope that the greatest businessman, ceo and product developer of our era is doing okay, and that this decision does not mean his health has taken a turn for the worse. he is an icon and idol who has made this world we live in a better place. we sincerely and deeply wish mr. jobs and his family the best. more from a commenter on the blog boy genius report : best of luck to steve!! i have nothing but love and respect for him and the way that he handled things at apple! he created the best tech company in the world! i wish him luck on whatever he does from here on out! and good luck to tim cook! he's gotta fill some size 100000000 shoes!!! even people who aren't generally apple fans praised jobs: while i may not like some of apple's practices and tactics, there is no denying that steve jobs took that company at its lowest point and made it into the gold standard of consumer technology, wrote eric geller, in a discussion cnn tech started on the google plus social network. not since bill gates has any tech executive been this iconic and well-known among mainstream consumers. others jokingly compared the news to other signs of the apocalypse, including the rare earthquake that hit the east coast earlier this week. earthquake, hurricane, middle east on the brink of war, now steve jobs resigns? the apocalypse is very, very near, folks, a twitter user wrote. and still others passed around bits of apple nostalgia. the blog boing boing shared an early apple commercial from 1984 . tim carmody, a blogger at wired, posted on google plus a 2001 video of jobs introducing the first apple store. feel free to share your thoughts about this news in the comments section below.
