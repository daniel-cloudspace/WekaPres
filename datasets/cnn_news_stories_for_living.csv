" harris said danielle is a model saver: the west middle school student has saved the most in the program over a two-year period. in addition to being on her school's honor role, the girl was given another honor saturday; kinecta and nix financial awarded her an additional $250 to put in her savings account. we want to keep encouraging her to save, said mel calloway, the executive vice president of kinecta and nix financial. we were very proud of her, she had a lot of discipline in her savings. harris said she gives out the money for the savings accounts through the donations she receives through her community group. she feels strongly about the programs she runs because of the inspiration she personally received: it was her own mentor who opened up harris's savings account for her decades ago. it helped me go to beauty college. what she did for me, i do for these kids. i know what it's like to feel like nothing, harris said. harris hopes the kids will finish college. i envision that they won't go to jail, they won't gang bang, she said. for harris, the watts riots aren't forgotten: 46 years after the violence, the neighborhood still faces deep problems. capt. phil tingirides of the los angeles police's southeast station said that watts is a very hard community and influenced by violent street gangs. the four housing projects in watts have traditionally been violent, with large amounts of drug dealing, he said. but he applauds how sweet alice is pushing the youth in the community to be financially independent. regarding the $5 that harris donates, tingirides stated: it's very symbolic on one hand and on the other hand, probably more money than anyone's legitimately ever given many of them.

" editor's note: lee rose emery is the writer of the award-winning blog lacitymom, tips from the carpool lane. (cnn) -- deep conversations with my kids seem to always arise in the car. the most important thing about marriage, i told my kids when the subject came up, is that you pick someone who is kind, and who really loves you. my son (then 6) replied, then i would definitely not marry john (his friend who punches.) my older daughter (then 8) said, boys can't marry boys, to which my son responded, but noah has two dads! and i had thought this was going to be an uncomplicated ride home. my son's preschool friend, noah, indeed does have two dads, who have become very much a part of our inner circle of friends. yet, in that moment in the car, my mind immediately jumped to the subject of the birds and the bees, and i started to feel unsure about what the kids' next questions would be, and how to thoughtfully and appropriately proceed. i decided to poll a range of parents and ask an expert to see how they would discuss the topic of nontraditional families with small children. laurie, 20, mother of two, from massachusetts, says she has not discussed the topic but it has been on her mind. our town is homogeneous and traditional. in not mentioning that there are alternative lifestyles, i worry that the kids will just assume that the traditional family structure is the 'right way'. i want to expose them to other ways of life, but i don't want it to be artificial. my brother converted to catholicism, and his views are becoming more and more conservative. we don't see them a lot, but as the kids get older i wonder what they are going to hear. a los angeles parent wrote to me, i did have this conversation in the framework of families ... because he is exposed to that in our life. my son is 6 and one client has two children with her partner. my son was more concerned with the science of it. which one was the no. 1 mommy? he thought the woman who carried the child would be the no. 1 mommy but was going to clarify who that was next time he saw my client. i told him that wasn't a polite question to ask. unsure if that was the right thing to say or not. he does not know about the birds and the bees but has observed that most kids have some identifiable parent of both sexes. parenting expert betsy brown braun said, there is nothing loaded about this for kids ... it is loaded for parents, as it challenges our ability to discuss our own feelings ... we are all victims of the attitudes and worlds in which we were raised. braun says how parents approach the topic of difference and how they communicate that to their children will either teach them to accept difference or not. braun, the author of you're not the boss of me: brat-proofing your four- to twelve-year-old child , also stressed that when the subject of same-sex couples arises it need not be a conversation about sexuality or reproduction, but instead about diversity. heather, 37, from massachusetts, has a 9-year-old adopted daughter. her daughter knows some children with same-sex parents from school, but no questions have come up on the topic. heather says, my faith is something that is very important to me, and it (same-sex partnership) is something i don't believe in, but i also feel that it is not my job to judge. should the topic arise, heather said she would discuss it as a choice that some people make. i called noah's dad, greg, and asked what his kids (he also has an 8-year-old daughter) say to other kids about their family. when noah and his sister meet a new friend and they ask who their mommy is, they say, 'i don't have a mommy. i have two dads.' the daughter says she acts as if it is a matter of fact, as if it is the silliest question in the world. noah's dad went on to say, adults get nervous about talking about it because they're thinking the kids are talking about sex. (just as i had that day in the car.) it's not about sex, he said, it's about interpersonal relationships. rebecca, from los angeles, said: we have two young children (ages 3 and 20 months.) and we also have some same-sex couple friends. we have never directly addressed the question, although we surely would if the kids asked. my view is that we do not directly address male-female couples so why treat same-sex couples any differently? we treat our same-sex couple friends and refer to them the same way we do for any other couple. for instance, dan and mark are usually discussed as a single unit, just like jane and jack. keeping the conversation on the level of relationship rather than sexuality makes it something kids can understand. but what if kids do want to know about the science and the logistics of how a child could be conceived without a man and a woman? with young children, braun says, keep it simple. to make a baby you need a part from a man and a woman. greg tells his children, two men can't have a baby, so we found a woman who was willing to help us. traditional family does not exist in the same way that it used to. my kids have friends with single parents, stepparents, adoptive parents and gay parents. dr. gloria walther, author and director of the walther pre-school in los angeles, advises that when we speak to our young children, we use a larger brush stroke to define family. the true thing is a family is made up of adults and children that love and trust. that intimate circle of family is defined by the people in it.

" in contrast, men in the northeast divorced less than the national average. five of the nine states that had divorce rates for men significantly below the u.s. average -- ranging from 6.1 to 8.5 -- were the northeastern states of connecticut, massachusetts, new jersey , new york and pennsylvania. the same was true for southern women. nine of the 14 states with divorce rates for women above the u.s. average, ranging from 10.7 to 16.2, were in the south. they included alabama, arkansas, georgia, kentucky, mississippi, oklahoma, tennessee, texas and west virginia. by comparison, four of the 10 states with below-average divorce rates for women, ranging from 6.0 to 8.9, were in the northeast: massachusetts, new jersey, new york and pennsylvania. a divorced mother of two who grew up in virginia and is now living in the atlanta area, lynn (not her real name) said she knows why her eight-year marriage failed. she and her ex-husband got married after a whirlwind three-month courtship, and she now knows, you really don't know somebody after three months. she didn't have a college degree when she got married, although she did eventually graduate from college and is now a teacher. lynn said she can see some reasons that southerners divorce at higher rates than the nation as a whole. where i grew up in virginia, i saw some of my peers not finishing high school, some not going to college and some not finishing college, she said. i saw a lot of people just staying in my hometown, staying in dead-end jobs, just settling, taking very little risk-taking for their careers. youth and lack of education can lead to higher divorce rates, said d'vera cohn , a senior writer with the pew research center, who wrote a report on the states of marriage and divorce . there's also an interactive map on the website. there tend to be higher divorce rates in states where women marry young, cohn said. education also may play a role. in general, less educated women marry at younger ages than college-educated women, and less educated couples have higher divorce rates. values about premarital sex associated with the bible belt and rural america may be encouraging people to marry early, at ages when they are likely to have less education and less income to support a long-lasting marriage, according to naomi cahn , law professor at the george washington university law school and co-author of red families v. blue families: legal polarization and the creation of culture. there's a moral crisis in red states that's produced by higher divorce rates and the disparity between parental values and behavior of young adults, said cahn. there is enormous tension between moral values and actual practices. lawrenceville, new jersey, resident jennifer debord, a married mother of two girls, made many decisions that could keep her 13-year marriage strong. she finished college, explored different careers, dated a few different men and lived with one boyfriend before figuring out what she wanted in a mate. debord and her husband, jason, who works as a broadway conductor and musician, both moved to new york city to pursue their careers in the arts. waiting allowed me to find the person who was right for me, not the person who was available, said debord, 42. in my mother's time, you married the first person you spent time with. i would have divorced that guy. i had a much better idea of who i was (when i married) at 29 versus who i was at 19. it's ironic that pressure on people to get married early also puts them at higher risk of divorce, said stephanie coontz , history and family studies professor at the evergreen state college in olympia, washington, director of research and public education for the council on contemporary families, and author of marriage, a history: how love conquered marriage and other books. the very fact that people feel less pressure to get married (in the northeast) means they can be more selective about who they marry and take their time, coontz said. they don't have to rush into it to please parents or avoid stigma of premarital sex. whatever the reasons for the south's higher divorce rate, christian author jonathan merritt said that church leaders are focusing more on divorce recovery when they should be focusing on preventing divorce. the faith community has a twofold responsibility regarding divorce: we need to respond to the divorce epidemic among our own ranks and we need to address the trend among the broader culture, said merritt, author of green like god: unlocking the divine plan for our planet, who also ministers at cross pointe church in duluth, georgia. marriages and families within faith communities are no healthier than in the rest of society. faith communities must provide support systems to salvage damaged marriages and resurrect dead marriages. meanwhile, divorce still pushes more women into poverty than men and affects their children, since children are still more likely to live with their mothers (75%) than their fathers (25%), according to the same u.s. census report. some other findings: &#8226; women divorcing in the past year were more likely than men to be in poverty (22% versus 11%). &#8226; women divorcing in the past year had less household income than their male counterparts. of those women, 27% had annual household incomes below $25,000, compared with 17% of divorced men. &#8226; women who divorced in the past year were more likely to receive public assistance than men (23% versus 15%). &#8226; children living with a parent divorcing in 2009 were more likely to live in poverty (28%) compared with other children (19%) and more likely to live in a rented home (53%) than other children (36%).

" (cnn) -- christian finnegan describes his character on the tbs comedy are we there yet? as the obnoxious wacky neighbor, but also admits he's ... probably more properly known as 'the white guy' on the show. for better or worse, it's a role he tackles with a bit of experience. this is not my first go-round as the representative of american whiteness. it's true. some people may remember him as chad from the classic chappelle show sketch mad real world. you can find it online, but be warned that it's beyond not safe for work. really, not even for the home office if you have pets who are easily offended. the point is: he plays the white guy. and you'll also notice that, at the time, he even played the fat guy. these days, however, finnegan is rather svelte. in our video interview, he discusses his dramatic weight loss and why he doesn't talk about it in his act. other fans -- or at least casual observers of things that happen on tv -- may also remember finnegan for his stint on vh1's best week ever where, for a time, his personal and professional life revolved around being on top of everything related to pop culture. it's a job he's happy to call his past. i am so relieved to not have to give a (expletive) any more, he says. like the kardashians ... that kind of came after 'best week ever' and it's such a delight to not have to know anything about those idiots. finnegan still considers himself somewhat savvy when it comes to contemporary lifestyles and people-being-famous-for-being-famous, but his real interest is government -- a passion that eventually led to regular appearances on msnbc's former show countdown with keith olbermann. i'm kind of obsessed with politics, finnegan says. it's really just sort of the only way a guy in his 30s can procrastinate and justify it. i will watch the same episode of hardball three times and tell myself, 'i'm watching the news. i'm staying on top of things.' no, you just don't want to do any work. these days finnegan is doing plenty of work on stage as a stand-up comedian. in july, we sat down with him in chicago during the just for laughs comedy festival , because one should never miss out on an opportunity to chat with the representative of american whiteness.
