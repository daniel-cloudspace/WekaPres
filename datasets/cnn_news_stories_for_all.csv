" (cnn) -- the bodies of a man and a girl were found inside a vehicle belonging to a suspect in an amber alert case, authorities said. authorities believe 2-year-old madeline samaan-fay was abducted by her father, mourad moni samaan. an amber alert was issued friday for madeline, who was last seen a week ago in sacramento. in a written statement, the fbi in sacramento, california, said the bodies were found in samaan's vehicle saturday night but did not identify the bodies, saying more information would be released later. the green toyota 4runner was found in a remote area of el dorado county, near placerville, california, the fbi said. the amber alert system has been put in place so that we can hopefully locate and safely take people back into custody and put the child back, if that's the case, el dorado county sheriff's office spokesman lt. bryan golmitz told cnn affiliate kcra. when you end up with cases like this, it's tough. calls made sunday afternoon to the fbi and sheriff's office, inquiring about the identity of the two bodies were not immediately returned. in an earlier news release, the fbi described the father as a 49-year-old egyptian-born u.s. citizen. the federal agency called the circumstances of the abduction particularly concerning, adding that officials have reason to believe that the child's life may be in danger. the girl, madeline, has brown hair and brown eyes, weighs about 28 pounds and stands 2 feet, 8 inches tall, according to the amber alert. the fbi was working on the case along with members of the sacramento police department, the sacramento county sheriff, the california highway patrol and the california department of justice.

" attorney stephen braga, who represented echols, said his newly freed client and baldwin were fascinated by new foods, cell phones and other technology friday. it was if you could see two little 5-year-old kids at their first christmas, braga told cbs' early show saturday. the idea you could take pictures with an iphone totally blew them away. misskelley spent friday night with his family near west memphis. cnn affiliate wreg said echols, who met his wife while serving time, and baldwin left saturday for undisclosed locations to enjoy seclusion. echols and baldwin entered what is known as an alford plea on three counts of first-degree murder. misskelley entered similar pleas to one count of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder. craighead county circuit judge david laser sentenced the three to the 18 years already served and imposed a 10-year suspended sentence -- meaning they could be returned to jail if they violate the law. i don't think that it will make the pain go away to the victims' families. i don't think it will make the pain go away to the defendant families, laser said, adding it was nevertheless the best for all involved. critics of the case against the men argued that no direct evidence tied the three to the murders and that a knife recovered from a lake near the home of one of the men could not have caused the boys' wounds. more recent dna testing also demonstrated no links, according to the men's supporters. baldwin said he didn't initially want to accept the deal. this was not justice, he said, adding that he dropped his opposition to pave the way for echols' release from death row. i have now spent half my life on death row, echols said in a statement released saturday. it is a torturous environment that no human being should have to endure, and it needed to end. i am innocent, as are jason and jessie, but i made this decision because i did not want to spend another day of my life behind those bars. while prosecuting attorney scott ellington said the pleas entered friday validate the decision of jurors who sent the men to prison, it also spares arkansas the possibility of a retrial, which would have been difficult to prosecute after so many years, or a potential civil lawsuit by the men. the trio had been on course to win the right to new trials later this year. ellington said he believes the pleas resolve the case. i have no reason to believe there was anyone else involved in the homicide of these three children but the three defendants who pled guilty today, he said. but he said the state could file charges against others if new evidence emerges implicating someone else in the case. john mark byers, whose stepson christopher byers was one of the three victims, said he believes the three men are innocent and releasing them without exonerating them of the crime is an outrage. they're innocent. they did not kill my son, byers said before the hearing. the father of another of the victims, steven branch, also blasted the decision, but for another reason. i don't know what kind of deal they worked up, steve branch told cnn affiliate wmc-tv before the hearing. now you can get some movie stars and a little bit of money behind you, and you can walk free for killing somebody. baldwin, who said he prays for the victims' families, told wmc saturday he hopes to return to school. right now, i am floating on the hands of people who love and care for me, people trying to get my feet under me and everything, he said. i'm just trusting god to take care of me. braga credited new dna evidence, a new hearing and a new judge as instrumental to friday's proceedings. the attorney claims the three freed men and supporters will push to see that the real killer eventually is found. he's still out there, braga told cbs. the right guys have been set free.

" (cnn) -- a man who went snorkeling with missing u.s. woman robyn gardner in aruba shortly before she vanished is the beneficiary of a $1.5 million accidental death insurance policy tied to gardner, a local official told cnn wednesday. gary giordano, 50, of gaithersburg, maryland, has told investigators that he went snorkeling with the gardner, 35, on august 2 and that she failed to return to shore with him. giordano and gardner flew to aruba on july 31. a local judge recently ordered that giordano could be held until august 31 in connection with gardner's disappearance.

" (cnn) -- the orange county, florida, sheriff's office spent $293,123.77 on detective work in the disappearance of 2-year-old caylee anthony in 2008, according to authorities, and it wants to be reimbursed. the sheriff's office is among three law agencies asking a county judge in orlando to order the girl's mother, casey, to pay their investigative costs. a court hearing on that request was set to take place thursday, but it was rescheduled to september 2, court spokeswoman karen levey said wednesday. anthony has been in seclusion since her july acquittal on murder charges in the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter and her subsequent release from jail. but in the same case, a florida jury convicted her on four misdemeanor counts of providing false information to law enforcement officers. prosecutors cite those misdemeanor convictions as the legal basis for their request that anthony pay for the police costs involved in her daughter's disappearance. caylee anthony's skeletonized remains were found in december 2008 in woods less than a mile from her grandparents' florida home. lt. paul zambouros of the orange county sheriff's office said the investigative costs of $293,123.77 are based largely on the criminal investigation division's work between july 15, 2008, and december 11, 2008. if other deputies' work were included, the reimbursement for cost of investigation would certainly be larger, zambouros said in an internal july 28 memo. prosecutors are also seeking reimbursement for the florida department of law enforcement's investigative expenses of $71,939.56 and the metropolitan bureau of investigation's expenses of $10,645.38, according to court records. anthony's attorney didn't return calls for a comment.

" los angeles (cnn) -- the scheduled arraignment of a california woman charged with murder for allegedly pushing her 7-month-old boy off the fourth story of a parking garage was delayed thursday, a district attorney's spokeswoman said. the arraignment for sonia hermosillo -- once planned for thursday -- has been pushed back to monday, said farrah emami, a spokeswoman for the orange county district attorney's office. authorities initially charged hermosillo, 31, of la habra, california, with attempted murder. but after the boy died wednesday, prosecutors upgraded it to one felony count of murder and one felony count of assault on a child with force likely to produce great bodily injury resulting in death. if convicted, hermosillo would face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in state prison, according to the district attorney's office. the incident occurred monday at a parking garage at the children's hospital of orange county. a witness saw the baby fall and called police. investigators interviewed several witnesses and reviewed a surveillance video from the garage. the image of a license plate on a 2000 chevy blazer seen leaving the garage shortly after the incident led police to hermosillo. authorities found an empty child seat in hermosillo's vehicle, according to a police statement. the baby had medical conditions that required regular treatment at the children's hospital, the district attorney's office said, and he wore a helmet for one of his medical conditions. hermosillo is accused of removing the victim's helmet and pushing her baby from the parking structure with the intention of murdering him with the four-story fall, the district attorney's office said. she then walked inside the hospital, validated her parking and left the scene, the office said. baby noe, as the district attorney's statement referred to the infant, was critically injured and died wednesday at the university of california-irvine medical center. the district attorney's statement said hermosillo has two other children. cnn's jillian ohlenschlaeger contributed to this report.

" baseball's lenny dykstra charged with indecent exposure by stella chan , , cnn lenny dykstra is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges on september 7 in los angeles. story highlights lenny dykstra charged thursday with two counts of indecent exposure charges accuse him of allegedly exposing himself to women solicited on craigslist the former mlb star is scheduled to be arraigned on september 7 los angeles (cnn) -- former major league baseball star lenny dykstra was charged thursday with two counts of indecent exposure for allegedly exposing himself to women he solicited on craigslist. the los angeles city attorney's office says the charges stem from multiple reports involving dykstra dating back to 2009. the charges accuse dykstra of placing ads on craigslist requesting a personal assistant or housekeeping services. the victims allege when they arrive, they were informed that the job also requires massage service and then he (dykstra) would disrobe and he would expose himself, said los angeles city attorney spokesman frank mateljan. dykstra, a three-time major league all-star outfielder who played for the new york mets and the philadelphia phillies, is scheduled to be arraigned on september 7 in los angeles.

" as the corrections department had previously said in a statement, officials are not releasing anthony's address or anything that might lead to the discovery of her location, said plessinger. this move is an effort to comply with a judge's order that anthony's whereabouts should remain confidential for her own safety. the court made a pretty strong statement, talking about how she's one of the most hated women in america, plessinger said. we want to make sure that she's treated like other offenders, in that if she violates these court orders, we will immediately notify the court. but we will put security measures in place. those measures include not inputting anthony's information into a public database, as is typically the case with offenders. in addition, her probation officer will not be identified by name. under the terms of her sentence, anthony must meet with her probation officer no later than the fifth day of each month. she can't change her residence or employment and, as plessinger said thursday, her probation officer would have to ok a travel permit if anthony wants to leave the county. her probation office is in orange county, unless she makes a request that is granted to move elsewhere in florida. none of anthony's attorneys was present when she met with the probation officer wednesday, the state spokeswoman said. in that meeting, the officer laid out for her, in detail, the conditions -- after which anthony indicated she understood those conditions, said plessinger. among other things, anthony's sentence requires her to pay the state of florida $20 per month toward the cost of supervision plus a 4% surcharge, unless the fees are waived. during the period covered by the sentence, she will not be allowed to drink excessively. she is also barred from any personal contact with the check-fraud victim for the duration of the probation period. orange county circuit judge stan strickland had earlier ordered anthony to serve a year of probation after her release in the charges involving her daughter, but a clerk misunderstood the judge and prepared an order that the judge later signed, instructing that anthony would serve the probation while in custody awaiting trial. the order was updated august 1 to add the words upon release. but anthony's lawyers contended that she couldn't be required to serve probation, arguing that she had already served it while in custody under a signed order from strickland. they also argued that serving the probation sentence now would violate constitutional protections against having to serve a sentence twice for the same offense. a florida appeals court affirmed earlier this week that anthony would have to serve the one-year probation sentence. she cannot, the court ruled, take advantage of an administrative error to avoid serving the sentence, which was first imposed in 2010. this backed up a ruling earlier this month by orange county chief judge belvin perry jr., who said strickland's verbal order was binding and ordered anthony to report for probation in florida on the bad-check charge by friday. the attorney general's office wrote that anthony upon her release (july 17), should have reported for probation -- something she did not do. in an emergency petition filed on wednesday with the same appeals court, anthony's defense team asked that the court overturn perry's order before the required date. they also asked the appellate court to strip perry of further jurisdiction in the case. cnn's samuel gardner iii contributed to this report.

" (cnn) -- casey anthony's white pontiac sunfire is a crushed slab in a florida junkyard nearly seven weeks after she was acquitted of murder in her 2-year-old daughter's death, according a person in a law office close to the case. an assistant in the office of mark lippman -- who represents george and cindy anthony, who owned the car before giving it to their daughter, casey -- said friday that the car was destroyed a day earlier. the assistant declined to be named. that the vehicle had been crushed was first reported and documented by florida tv station wofl. the car, and the odor emanating from its trunk, had been central to the prosecution's case in anthony's murder trial. on june 27, 2008, she abandoned the pontiac at an orlando business, saying it had run out of gas, according to testimony. it later was towed to a wrecker yard, where it remained until july 15 of that year, when george and cindy anthony got a letter from the yard and went to pick up the car. several witnesses, including a tow yard employee and george anthony, said there was a vile smell coming from car's trunk. the prosecution alleged -- and expert witnesses testified -- that the odor was that of human decomposition. they claimed casey anthony duct-taped her daughter's mouth and nose to suffocate her, and then put the body in the pontiac's trunk before disposing of it. but the defense rebutted these claims, with attorney jose baez blasting what he called the state's fantasy of forensics in his closing argument. defense attorneys maintained the child, caylee, drowned in the anthony's above-ground pool on june 16, and that casey anthony and her father, george anthony, panicked upon finding her there and covered up the death. george anthony denied that in his testimony. baez claimed a phantom stain in the trunk should have included more in the way of dna evidence. he said the state used junk science relating to the odor and stain in the pontiac's trunk to reach its conclusions. after anthony was cleared on the murder charge -- and convicted on four lesser counts of misleading law enforcement -- alternate juror russell huekler told hln that he had a difficult time accepting that caylee's body had been in the car trunk. in session's nancy leung contributed to this report.

" (cnn) -- it was the deathbed request from the mother of a longtime fugitive that finally led the fbi to william walter asher iii. for 36 years, asher had been on the run -- ever since he escaped from a prison camp in 1975 rather than serve time for a deadly robbery. but last week, federal agents caught up to him. he had changed his name, worked for a trucking company and lived with a woman who had no idea about his criminal past. after 36 years of looking over his shoulder william walter asher iii, now 66 years old, is finally back where he belongs -- in prison, the fbi trumpeted in a press statement released monday. for years, it seemed that the fbi would never nab asher. in 1966, he and three accomplices robbed a san francisco bar, shooting and then beating the bartender to death, authorities said. asher was 20 at the time. he fled to chicago, hiding out for a year before he was caught. he was tried, convicted and sentenced to life in prison. the file would have closed there. but eight years into his sentence, asher escaped from a prison in el dorado county, california -- aided by a female accomplice. the fbi tracked asher to the northern territories of canada. they learned he had assumed a different name, that he worked as a long haul trucker, that he had married and raised a family. he eventually separated from his wife, and she didn't know where he went next. interestingly enough, several years ago one of asher's daughters contacted the fbi for information on the location of her father, the fbi said. the trail grew cold until 2005. shortly before she died, asher's mother asked relatives to get in touch with her son. she asked various family members to assist her in using the 'secret' number to call 'billy,' the fbi said. agents had been tipped off about the conversation by a source. armed with that information, agents scoured phone records of people who they believed may have helped fulfill the mother's request. they found two phone calls made to a home in salida, california, to a man named garry donald webb. the calls had been made two days before the mother died. agents looked at webb's driver's license photo. it resembled an older, thinner asher. authorities placed the home under surveillance. they also kept a watch on a trucking business where he was said to work. on friday, agents saw asher leaving the home and confronted him. after some initial discussion asher admitted his true identity, the fbi said. he had been living with a woman for more than a decade. she was unaware of his fugitive status, the fbi said. asher was taken into custody and to a tracy, california, facility that processes inmates newly committed to state prison. cnn's scott thompson contributed to this report "

" it was a tricky path for lou bordisso, 57 . his job as a licensed therapist was to help people in their worst moments. he counseled feuding married couples, families in distress and criminal defendants who were found not guilty by reason of insanity in his forensic mental health work for contra costa county in california. he was also a bishop. by no means was he ready to slow down. but seven years ago, he started losing his way around office buildings. he'd forget where the conference room was located. he missed meeting friends because he couldn't find the exit from the macy's department store in san francisco. finally in may 2010 after spinal taps, neuropsychological testing, mris and other tests, the doctor told him he had early onset alzheimer's. he tried to compensate for the deficiencies in his memory by working harder and taking more notes. although he had testified in court and written reports to judges in his role evaluating defendants' mental health, he realized that the disease affected the quality of his work. i had been writing a lot of reports to the judge making considerable errors, bordisso said. it became evident with my co-workers, peers and supervisors. it was time to take some time off. the decision was mutual. but retiring from his full-time counseling job and his duties as bishop was devastating, he said. it's a sense of despair and grief, he said. i'm going through what's similar to when someone loses a loved one in life. i'm hopefully moving to the point of acceptance. he continues his counseling work, although he has drastically reduced the number of clients he sees. because his long-term memory is better than his short-term memory, bordisso moved back to his childhood home in sacramento, california. the move makes it easier for him navigate his neighborhood and home. i'm used to contributing as a responsible, accountable person, he said. there's nothing worse for me than not being able to give back. being on the receiving end of services is granting me a new perspective in life. i'm becoming more appreciative of what others are going through. my sense of empathy has increased as well.

" editor's note: freelance writer amanda enayati contributes regularly to cnnhealth.com. (cnn) -- most anyone you stop on the street knows something about post-traumatic stress disorder, also referred to as ptsd. but mention post-traumatic growth and you are more likely than not to be met with blank stares. post-traumatic growth -- the ability not only to bounce back from adversity but also to flourish -- is an ever-present theme in most of our epic tales and spiritual traditions. and science is finally catching up. researchers have discovered that the key to post-traumatic growth is resilience, and also that resilience is not just an advantage of a lucky few. a lot of people erroneously believe that if you didn't get a good scramble of genes, resilience is not going to be your thing, says dr. karen reivich, co-author of the resilience factor. but resilience is a set of skills that, with effort, anyone can develop. that's important because there is no magic pill here. how can i get this resilience training? was the question i was most asked last week when i wrote about comprehensive soldier fitness, the army initiative to help soldiers build resilience and deal with high levels of sustained stress . since reivich also happens to be the research associate and primary trainer at the penn resiliency project and the developer of the army's master resilience training course, i asked her to guide me through the basic steps to becoming more resilient. according to reivich, resilience is made up of six basic building blocks. become more optimistic optimism is believing that good things can happen and that you can effect positive change in your life and in the world. pessimists underestimate how much control they have. they tend to focus their mental energy on things they can't do anything about. they also often hold the belief that optimists have their heads in the sand. in reality, though, most optimists can accurately assess what's going on; they just choose to place their attention on where they have control and influence as well on positive aspects of situations. that takes effort, reivich says. for many of us, it's easier to navigate toward and get consumed by the negative. with some mindfulness, you can direct your attention toward positive aspects of situations and what you can control. this is not outside anyone's purview. it is a habit that can be developed. an exercise to help boost optimism involves paying closer attention to the good things you have received in life. basically, says reivich, science corroborating grandma's advice. like a gratitude journal? i flash an old oprah episode. we call it a 'hunk of good stuff' journal. people who make a habit of gratitude have better health, better sleep, better life satisfaction, less depression, less stress, all sorts of things. we have people write down three good things that happened that day and a couple of sentences about each, like what it meant to them and how they're going to get more of it the next day. increase mental agility mental agility is the ability to see situations fully, accurately and from multiple perspectives. the mentally agile are able to avoid thinking traps when something goes wrong. thinking traps limit your flexibility because each of them cause you to only see a small aspect of what's going on. two of the more common thinking traps are the me-me-me trap (the tendency to always blame yourself) or the them-them-them trap (always blaming others). the key here is to identify which thinking trap you fall into and to develop your ability to be more flexible and accurate in your understanding of adverse situations. once you become aware of the trap, you can hit the pause button and repeat a catchphrase to help you get a more accurate and flexible grasp of the situation. the catchphrase for the me me me trap, for example, is look outward. seek self-awareness self-awareness helps you understand your habits of thinking, feeling and acting so you can ask yourself, how's that working for you? it involves listening to your interpretation of adverse circumstances to figure out your internal dialogue under stress. when something triggers you -- an activating event as little as not getting a parking spot or as big as losing a loved one -- where does your mind go? we teach people to look for patterns. does your brain start sending out themes like 'loss,' 'danger' or 'trespass'? these patterns are like the glasses that color the way you see all events in your life -- good and bad. one simple way to exercise self-awareness is to keep a journal of your thoughts and beliefs during stressful periods. what was the first thing that popped into your mind when something happened? and what was that about? reivich asks. self-regulate self-regulation involves learning how to reverse counterproductive thinking by having more appropriate reactions. the less resilient often catastrophize when something happens. we call it making a himalaya out of a mountain, reivich says. it's something, but you make it bigger. the downward spiral of negative catastrophic thinking makes you feel out of control. the problem then becomes a runaway train and creates huge anxiety. and that blocks purposeful action. reivich suggests an exercise called putting it in perspective, which may at first seem counterintuitive. the exercise involves creating three columns. first, record all catastrophic thoughts under the worst-case scenario column. next, write down the wildly unlikely, best-case scenarios. and finally, list the most likely outcomes. reivich finds that this exercise helps people assess things they are going to have to confront and often leads to quite dramatic shifts in their emotions as well as the ability to tackle what's in front of them. and it takes a total of seven minutes. focus on strengths this aspect of resilience involves identifying your top character strengths. that might be your bravery, wisdom, sense of humor or the ability to love and be loved, reivich observes. people can usually tell you what their strengths are and who they are at their best. those who tend to stay more resilient in the face of adversity are using these strengths to overcome. they feel energized, motivated and true to themselves. (readers can take penn's via survey of character strengths test (and a number of other related tests) by registering for free at http://www.authentichappiness.com/ develop better connections the myth about resilience is that it's a solitary sport. but the key message here is that relying on others is necessary and it is certainly not a sign of weakness. we teach people techniques that help build positive relationships, such as dr. shelly gable's active and constructive responding technique . most of us believe that the quality of our relationship is determined by the answer to the question, will you be there for me when things go wrong? but the real question is, will you be there for me when things go right? research shows that people respond in four typical ways to good news, and only one of those ways strengthens our relationships; the others erode relationships over time: (1) the conversation killer ( that's great! as you're texting or on the computer); (2) the conversation hijacker ( that reminds me of my good news! ); (3) the joy thief ( but what about ...? and going on to list the downsides); and (4) the joy multiplier (involves constructive responding -- that is, asking questions, offering praise, favoring the positive experience, being authentically interested in the details). the beauty is that multiplying joy is not hard to do. it just requires intention and attention. at the end of the day, reivich says, none of this stuff we're teaching is wildly difficult. they're basic, tried-and-true principles. but they do require practice. we live in a culture that is so quick-fix oriented, so if something doesn't lead to dramatic and huge change overnight we give up. these things take persistence and effort.

" (cnn) -- if you're a woman contemplating surgery on your female parts, you'll find plenty of ladies chatting and blogging away about their experiences, often on websites adorned with pink ribbons. but if you're a man considering male surgery there's not so much out there. there's no ribbon for, say, penis surgery, and comparatively few men trading stories and sharing advice. women are much more engaged with their health, says dr. dennis pessis, president-elect of the american urological association. it's gotten better in the past 15 years, but still, men don't always seek out the best treatments for themselves. penis surgery has been in the spotlight this week as a civil trial in kentucky made national headlines. phillip seaton, a kentucky truck driver, sued his urologist, dr. john patterson, saying he went in for a circumcision but left the surgery with part of his penis amputated. patterson says seaton had cancer and needed the amputation or he would have died. the doctor won the case on wednesday, according to cnn affiliate wdrb . seaton's experience is certainly rare, surgery on the penis isn't. while good statistics are hard to find, tens of thousands of men in the united states get circumcised as adults. other common surgeries include implants for men suffering erectile dysfunction and removal of genital warts. here's the empowered patient list of questions every man should ask before having these procedures on this most valued and delicate of organs. 1. do i really need this procedure? think twice (or more) before having the surgery. it's a highly vascularized organ, which is a fancy way of saying there is a lot of blood running in and out of it, so cutting into it can be risky. men getting circumcised as adults should consider the risk of bleeding, especially if they're on a blood thinner, including aspirin. getting implants requires cutting, too, and doctors urge men with erectile dysfunction to try other, less risky, treatments first, such as drugs like viagra, penile injections, or a penis pump, an external device that fits over the organ. you'll also need to choose what kind of anesthesia you'll want for your circumcision. you can opt for a local anesthetic and a sedative -- you'll be (or should be) relaxed but awake. men who are especially anxious about the surgery often opt for general anesthesia, which is slightly more risky but ensures they'll be totally out for the procedure. as for genital warts, if a man is not experiencing problems such as itching, burning or pain, he may not need treatment, according to the mayo clinic. 2. what are my treatment options? there is more than one type of penile implant and there is more than one way to remove genital warts. doctors tend to specialize in one method over the other, so make sure your doctor lays out all the options and refers you to another doctor who can perform the procedure the way you prefer. there are two types of implants. with inflatable implants, doctors put cylinders inside the penis, a pump in the scrotum, and a fluid reserve inside either the scrotum or the abdominal wall. before sex, you pump the fluid into the cylinders to create an erection. after sex, you activate a release valve in the scrotum to let the fluid out. the second type of implant involves putting semi-rigid rods into the penis, and it is bent away from the body to have sex (think of it as a goose-necked desk lamp that can be pointed in various directions). for more on various types of penile implants, see information from the mayo clinic and the american urological association. for warts, you can treat them yourself or your doctor can treat them. if you choose the diy approach, your doctor prescribes a medicine for you to apply at home. if you prefer to have your doctor treat the warts, there are several options: your doctor can apply a medicine, which is sometimes a stronger version of what you can apply at home. there is also an option to cauterize or laser the warts, or to freeze them off with liquid nitrogen. you should give yourself some time to make the right decision, says dr. gopal badlani, a urologist at wake forest baptist medical center. you don't want to decide at the first appointment. for more information on the various options for removing genital warts, see information from the centers for disease control and prevention. 3. doctor, how many of these procedures have you done? look for a urologist who regularly performs the procedure you need. some urologists do nothing but treat kidney stones or urinary incontinence, and you don't want that urologist doing your circumcision, says dr. irwin goldstein, director of san diego sexual medicine. they need to know what they're doing so they don't remove too much or too little skin, or create a new problem like an angled penis. while there's no magic number, goldstein says if you're having a circumcision, find someone who does at least two or three a month. plus, you should ask the doctor for names of his or her previous circumcision patients. it's sort of like fixing your roof -- you want to talk to a client who's used that roofer, he advises. ask about the doctor's follow-up: was he available, or did he just do the surgery and you didn't hear from him again? for implants, also try to find a doctor who does at least two or three a month, goldstein advises, not someone who just dabbles in the procedure. we did three implants monday, just to give you a sense of how often some doctors do these, goldstein adds. the removal of genital warts isn't as complicated as circumcision or implant surgery, but still make sure it's something your doctor does regularly. 4. will the treatment really cure my problem? badlani says no matter how much he counsels his patients before implant surgery, most are disappointed the implants didn't give them as large an erection as they had when they were 18. ninety-five percent of the time, after the surgery the patient feels shortchanged. they say, 'doc, i expected it to be much longer,' badlani says. men need to have more realistic expectations. men are also sometimes surprised that their genital warts come back after treatment. but the mayo clinic says genital warts are likely to recur because even after you remove them, you still carry the virus that causes warts, called the human papillomavirus (hpv). 5. should i clean up before the surgery? cutting into the penis leaves you vulnerable to infection, so ask your doctor if you should be scrubbing at home before surgery day. goldstein tells his circumcision patients to clean with a special antiseptic once a day for three days before the surgery. he has his implant patients wash up morning and night for seven days before surgery, and take antibiotics for three days before. we're inserting a foreign body into the penis. the chances for things to go wrong are magnified, so we want to take all precautions, he says. cnn's sabriya rice contributed to this report.

" jobs said in january 2009 that doctors said he dropped so much weight because of a hormone imbalance that has been 'robbing' me of the proteins my body needs to be healthy. sophisticated blood tests have confirmed this diagnosis. the former ceo never disclosed any more details; doctors unaffiliated with his care said a variety of conditions could have caused the weight loss, including cancer and diabetes. if related to his a recurrence of his cancer, a pancreatic tumor would typically lead to an overproduction of hormones including glucagon, which results in weight loss if produced in excess, dr. jeffrey mechanick said in 2009. mechanick, a clinical professor at mount sinai medical center in new york, was not involved in jobs' care. that same year, jobs underwent a liver transplant in tennessee. dr. james d. eason of methodist university hospital transplant institute announced in june 2009 that mr. jobs is now recovering well and has an excellent prognosis. the odds are against the pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cancer patient who has a liver transplant, but close to half of the patients may be free of cancer four to five years after the transplantation, said dr. simon lo, director of the pancreatic and biliary diseases program at cedars-sinai medical center in los angeles, who did not treat jobs. still, relatively few liver transplants have been performed as a treatment for neuroendocrine tumors, making it a somewhat experimental option, devoe said. if the patient has a lot of disease in the liver, it can extend life, but there's no guarantee that this will remove all of the cancer remaining in the body. and immunosupression drugs required after a liver transplant could allow any remaining cancer to grow faster, devoe said. in rare cases, immune suppression itself can also cause cancer, said dr. james yao, oncologist at the university of texas m.d. anderson cancer center in houston, who has not treated jobs. on the bright side, there are two new cancer drugs that have been approved this year that may apply to someone in jobs' situation, experts say. everolimus is available to treat pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and prevents transplant rejection. but there are serious potential side effects, which may include lung or breathing problems, infections and renal failure, which may lead to death. sunitinib malate is prescribed for the treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, kidney cancer and gist, a rare cancer of the bowel, esophagus or stomach. this too carries its risks; it can cause liver problems and death. the good news that this is an area where there are a lot of advances, yao said.

" still, he was trying to do everything right. he was on a statin medicine, which he said had lowered his cholesterol from just under 300 to 125. total cholesterol of 240 or above is considered a risk factor for heart disease. also, bare's typical diet was better than most: oatmeal for breakfast, fruit for lunch, chicken or mexican food for dinner. he didn't smoke. he was not overweight or diabetic. friends are saying if there's anybody in the group that shouldn't be going through this, it would be me, because of my lifestyle, bare said. but, he added, my brother has gone through this. my mom has gone through this. i knew it was coming. dr. dean ornish, who has researched the relationship between lifestyle and health, says even the most malignant family history can be overcome. i don't think anyone is doomed to have heart disease, said ornish, founder and president of the preventive medicine research institute . you know, even if your mother and your father and your sister and your brother all die from heart disease it doesn't mean you need ever to die from it, he added. it just means you need to make bigger changes in your life than someone else who doesn't have those kinds of genes. for someone like bare, that might mean adopting a plant-based diet, ornish said. heart attack-proof diet? red flag bare was worried enough about his heart health that he underwent a coronary calcium scan four years ago. the test showed plaque building up in his coronary arteries. my score was 111, bare said. zero is the best score. five is the average score for someone his age. a score over 100 meant an elevated risk of heart attack. he had another coronary calcium scan this year. his score was up to 243. a survey by the american heart association suggests many are misguided about their heart health. some 39% of americans think their heart health is ideal. the actual number is less than 1%, said nancy brown, ceo of the heart association. will you have a heart attack? tests that can tell we're very concerned because we're seeing the risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease increasing, brown said. future bare has returned to school part-time until he regains his strength and he's hoping bypass surgery has given him a new lease on life. the science teacher says he'd like to travel, maybe see a volcano erupt. i'm told that i'm good for another 40 years or so, and i'm hoping that's the case, but with my history, i'm going to have to watch it, bare said. even so, bare said he has no plans to give up the food he loves.

" harris said danielle is a model saver: the west middle school student has saved the most in the program over a two-year period. in addition to being on her school's honor role, the girl was given another honor saturday; kinecta and nix financial awarded her an additional $250 to put in her savings account. we want to keep encouraging her to save, said mel calloway, the executive vice president of kinecta and nix financial. we were very proud of her, she had a lot of discipline in her savings. harris said she gives out the money for the savings accounts through the donations she receives through her community group. she feels strongly about the programs she runs because of the inspiration she personally received: it was her own mentor who opened up harris's savings account for her decades ago. it helped me go to beauty college. what she did for me, i do for these kids. i know what it's like to feel like nothing, harris said. harris hopes the kids will finish college. i envision that they won't go to jail, they won't gang bang, she said. for harris, the watts riots aren't forgotten: 46 years after the violence, the neighborhood still faces deep problems. capt. phil tingirides of the los angeles police's southeast station said that watts is a very hard community and influenced by violent street gangs. the four housing projects in watts have traditionally been violent, with large amounts of drug dealing, he said. but he applauds how sweet alice is pushing the youth in the community to be financially independent. regarding the $5 that harris donates, tingirides stated: it's very symbolic on one hand and on the other hand, probably more money than anyone's legitimately ever given many of them.

" editor's note: lee rose emery is the writer of the award-winning blog lacitymom, tips from the carpool lane. (cnn) -- deep conversations with my kids seem to always arise in the car. the most important thing about marriage, i told my kids when the subject came up, is that you pick someone who is kind, and who really loves you. my son (then 6) replied, then i would definitely not marry john (his friend who punches.) my older daughter (then 8) said, boys can't marry boys, to which my son responded, but noah has two dads! and i had thought this was going to be an uncomplicated ride home. my son's preschool friend, noah, indeed does have two dads, who have become very much a part of our inner circle of friends. yet, in that moment in the car, my mind immediately jumped to the subject of the birds and the bees, and i started to feel unsure about what the kids' next questions would be, and how to thoughtfully and appropriately proceed. i decided to poll a range of parents and ask an expert to see how they would discuss the topic of nontraditional families with small children. laurie, 20, mother of two, from massachusetts, says she has not discussed the topic but it has been on her mind. our town is homogeneous and traditional. in not mentioning that there are alternative lifestyles, i worry that the kids will just assume that the traditional family structure is the 'right way'. i want to expose them to other ways of life, but i don't want it to be artificial. my brother converted to catholicism, and his views are becoming more and more conservative. we don't see them a lot, but as the kids get older i wonder what they are going to hear. a los angeles parent wrote to me, i did have this conversation in the framework of families ... because he is exposed to that in our life. my son is 6 and one client has two children with her partner. my son was more concerned with the science of it. which one was the no. 1 mommy? he thought the woman who carried the child would be the no. 1 mommy but was going to clarify who that was next time he saw my client. i told him that wasn't a polite question to ask. unsure if that was the right thing to say or not. he does not know about the birds and the bees but has observed that most kids have some identifiable parent of both sexes. parenting expert betsy brown braun said, there is nothing loaded about this for kids ... it is loaded for parents, as it challenges our ability to discuss our own feelings ... we are all victims of the attitudes and worlds in which we were raised. braun says how parents approach the topic of difference and how they communicate that to their children will either teach them to accept difference or not. braun, the author of you're not the boss of me: brat-proofing your four- to twelve-year-old child , also stressed that when the subject of same-sex couples arises it need not be a conversation about sexuality or reproduction, but instead about diversity. heather, 37, from massachusetts, has a 9-year-old adopted daughter. her daughter knows some children with same-sex parents from school, but no questions have come up on the topic. heather says, my faith is something that is very important to me, and it (same-sex partnership) is something i don't believe in, but i also feel that it is not my job to judge. should the topic arise, heather said she would discuss it as a choice that some people make. i called noah's dad, greg, and asked what his kids (he also has an 8-year-old daughter) say to other kids about their family. when noah and his sister meet a new friend and they ask who their mommy is, they say, 'i don't have a mommy. i have two dads.' the daughter says she acts as if it is a matter of fact, as if it is the silliest question in the world. noah's dad went on to say, adults get nervous about talking about it because they're thinking the kids are talking about sex. (just as i had that day in the car.) it's not about sex, he said, it's about interpersonal relationships. rebecca, from los angeles, said: we have two young children (ages 3 and 20 months.) and we also have some same-sex couple friends. we have never directly addressed the question, although we surely would if the kids asked. my view is that we do not directly address male-female couples so why treat same-sex couples any differently? we treat our same-sex couple friends and refer to them the same way we do for any other couple. for instance, dan and mark are usually discussed as a single unit, just like jane and jack. keeping the conversation on the level of relationship rather than sexuality makes it something kids can understand. but what if kids do want to know about the science and the logistics of how a child could be conceived without a man and a woman? with young children, braun says, keep it simple. to make a baby you need a part from a man and a woman. greg tells his children, two men can't have a baby, so we found a woman who was willing to help us. traditional family does not exist in the same way that it used to. my kids have friends with single parents, stepparents, adoptive parents and gay parents. dr. gloria walther, author and director of the walther pre-school in los angeles, advises that when we speak to our young children, we use a larger brush stroke to define family. the true thing is a family is made up of adults and children that love and trust. that intimate circle of family is defined by the people in it. "
" in contrast, men in the northeast divorced less than the national average. five of the nine states that had divorce rates for men significantly below the u.s. average -- ranging from 6.1 to 8.5 -- were the northeastern states of connecticut, massachusetts, new jersey , new york and pennsylvania. the same was true for southern women. nine of the 14 states with divorce rates for women above the u.s. average, ranging from 10.7 to 16.2, were in the south. they included alabama, arkansas, georgia, kentucky, mississippi, oklahoma, tennessee, texas and west virginia. by comparison, four of the 10 states with below-average divorce rates for women, ranging from 6.0 to 8.9, were in the northeast: massachusetts, new jersey, new york and pennsylvania. a divorced mother of two who grew up in virginia and is now living in the atlanta area, lynn (not her real name) said she knows why her eight-year marriage failed. she and her ex-husband got married after a whirlwind three-month courtship, and she now knows, you really don't know somebody after three months. she didn't have a college degree when she got married, although she did eventually graduate from college and is now a teacher. lynn said she can see some reasons that southerners divorce at higher rates than the nation as a whole. where i grew up in virginia, i saw some of my peers not finishing high school, some not going to college and some not finishing college, she said. i saw a lot of people just staying in my hometown, staying in dead-end jobs, just settling, taking very little risk-taking for their careers. youth and lack of education can lead to higher divorce rates, said d'vera cohn , a senior writer with the pew research center, who wrote a report on the states of marriage and divorce . there's also an interactive map on the website. there tend to be higher divorce rates in states where women marry young, cohn said. education also may play a role. in general, less educated women marry at younger ages than college-educated women, and less educated couples have higher divorce rates. values about premarital sex associated with the bible belt and rural america may be encouraging people to marry early, at ages when they are likely to have less education and less income to support a long-lasting marriage, according to naomi cahn , law professor at the george washington university law school and co-author of red families v. blue families: legal polarization and the creation of culture. there's a moral crisis in red states that's produced by higher divorce rates and the disparity between parental values and behavior of young adults, said cahn. there is enormous tension between moral values and actual practices. lawrenceville, new jersey, resident jennifer debord, a married mother of two girls, made many decisions that could keep her 13-year marriage strong. she finished college, explored different careers, dated a few different men and lived with one boyfriend before figuring out what she wanted in a mate. debord and her husband, jason, who works as a broadway conductor and musician, both moved to new york city to pursue their careers in the arts. waiting allowed me to find the person who was right for me, not the person who was available, said debord, 42. in my mother's time, you married the first person you spent time with. i would have divorced that guy. i had a much better idea of who i was (when i married) at 29 versus who i was at 19. it's ironic that pressure on people to get married early also puts them at higher risk of divorce, said stephanie coontz , history and family studies professor at the evergreen state college in olympia, washington, director of research and public education for the council on contemporary families, and author of marriage, a history: how love conquered marriage and other books. the very fact that people feel less pressure to get married (in the northeast) means they can be more selective about who they marry and take their time, coontz said. they don't have to rush into it to please parents or avoid stigma of premarital sex. whatever the reasons for the south's higher divorce rate, christian author jonathan merritt said that church leaders are focusing more on divorce recovery when they should be focusing on preventing divorce. the faith community has a twofold responsibility regarding divorce: we need to respond to the divorce epidemic among our own ranks and we need to address the trend among the broader culture, said merritt, author of green like god: unlocking the divine plan for our planet, who also ministers at cross pointe church in duluth, georgia. marriages and families within faith communities are no healthier than in the rest of society. faith communities must provide support systems to salvage damaged marriages and resurrect dead marriages. meanwhile, divorce still pushes more women into poverty than men and affects their children, since children are still more likely to live with their mothers (75%) than their fathers (25%), according to the same u.s. census report. some other findings: &#8226; women divorcing in the past year were more likely than men to be in poverty (22% versus 11%). &#8226; women divorcing in the past year had less household income than their male counterparts. of those women, 27% had annual household incomes below $25,000, compared with 17% of divorced men. &#8226; women who divorced in the past year were more likely to receive public assistance than men (23% versus 15%). &#8226; children living with a parent divorcing in 2009 were more likely to live in poverty (28%) compared with other children (19%) and more likely to live in a rented home (53%) than other children (36%).

" (cnn) -- christian finnegan describes his character on the tbs comedy are we there yet? as the obnoxious wacky neighbor, but also admits he's ... probably more properly known as 'the white guy' on the show. for better or worse, it's a role he tackles with a bit of experience. this is not my first go-round as the representative of american whiteness. it's true. some people may remember him as chad from the classic chappelle show sketch mad real world. you can find it online, but be warned that it's beyond not safe for work. really, not even for the home office if you have pets who are easily offended. the point is: he plays the white guy. and you'll also notice that, at the time, he even played the fat guy. these days, however, finnegan is rather svelte. in our video interview, he discusses his dramatic weight loss and why he doesn't talk about it in his act. other fans -- or at least casual observers of things that happen on tv -- may also remember finnegan for his stint on vh1's best week ever where, for a time, his personal and professional life revolved around being on top of everything related to pop culture. it's a job he's happy to call his past. i am so relieved to not have to give a (expletive) any more, he says. like the kardashians ... that kind of came after 'best week ever' and it's such a delight to not have to know anything about those idiots. finnegan still considers himself somewhat savvy when it comes to contemporary lifestyles and people-being-famous-for-being-famous, but his real interest is government -- a passion that eventually led to regular appearances on msnbc's former show countdown with keith olbermann. i'm kind of obsessed with politics, finnegan says. it's really just sort of the only way a guy in his 30s can procrastinate and justify it. i will watch the same episode of hardball three times and tell myself, 'i'm watching the news. i'm staying on top of things.' no, you just don't want to do any work. these days finnegan is doing plenty of work on stage as a stand-up comedian. in july, we sat down with him in chicago during the just for laughs comedy festival , because one should never miss out on an opportunity to chat with the representative of american whiteness.

" there was a stretch in which date night was the only time i'd make a move -- which wouldn't be terrible if it weren't already established the week before that i was going to get lucky that night, anyway. it was like turning on the television and being surprised to see that american idol was on at the same time and channel it was last week. that's not getting lucky; that's just tuning in for your regularly scheduled program. date night had turned sex into a regularly scheduled program. not to mention it put all of this pressure on us to have sex, because what would it mean if we didn't? we no longer were attracted to each other? he's cheating on me? my breath stinks? it's the date night catch-22: bored if you do, mortified if you don't. no, for us, it had to go. i know, i know, relationships are more than just sex, and date nights allow parents the time to talk and not be interrupted by the needs of their children. i get it and totally agree. but i would add that if you routinely find yourself not thinking about having sex with the person you're out date-nighting with, then perhaps it's more than the kids' busy schedule that's keeping you two apart. no one goes out on a first date hoping only to run errands in the future. this is just one of the many reasons why i believe that people who argue against marriage equality have few, if any, gay couples in their lives. if they had some gay couples as friends, then they'd know that we aren't having sex, just like them, and we aren't that big a deal. in fact, if conservative politicians were really interested in protecting marriage, they'd ban date night; it's a much bigger threat. i'm being silly, of course. but it is amazing to me how so many of the highs and lows of couples' relationships really are the same -- regardless of the people involved. i told a friend i was considering writing this column, and he joked that he didn't believe his wife even bothered brushing her teeth until date night. we're so busy with the kids, he said. who has time for sex? can you string together five words more sad than who has time for sex? and yet, that's where so many of us are, right? strapped for cash, pressed for time and looking for love. this year, the u.s. bureau of labor statistics reported that in married couple households with children under 18, both parents worked in 58 percent of them. that, together with the fact that kids are far busier with scheduled activities today than a generation ago, it's little wonder why, in a recent poll, a third of those polled said they would give up sex for a week rather than give up their smartphone for a week. i guess they've figured they've already given up sex, but if they lose their smartphones, they won't know what time to pick their kids up. but notice i said they and not we. i'm not giving up sex for a smartphone or anything else, which is why when the school year starts, date night is not going on the calendar. i didn't share all of this because i'm unhappy in my relationship but rather because i am happy in my relationship. i want to be with my partner for the rest of my life, so i'm resisting any construct that could undermine the most essential element for any long term couple: passion. life is busy, and if you're married with children, it can feel like a complete rat race. but i'm ok with the race as long as chasing the person i love is part of it. for me, date nights are great in theory, but the romantic chase in the midst of life's chaos is what i prefer. i know that's not for everyone, but neither are handcuffs. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of lz granderson.

" editor's note: barbara ehrenreich's book nickel and dimed: on (not) getting by in america (macmillan) has just been released in a 10th-anniversary edition with a new afterword by the author. (cnn) -- everyone to the left of michele bachmann seems to agree that america's most immediate problem isn't the budget deficit, but the jobs deficit. fourteen million americans are unemployed, and the number ranges up to almost 16 million if you include those who want full-time jobs but can only find part-time ones. put all those people to work, and they will cheerfully run out to the malls and spend, thus reigniting the engine of consumer capitalism. or so the conventional wisdom goes. but just how many jobs will the economy have to generate to cure the jobs deficit -- 14 million? sixteen million? or a whole lot more? the answer depends not just on the number of people out of work but on the quality of jobs being offered. according to a january report from the national employment law project, 76% of the new jobs generated in 2010 were of the low-paying variety, offering between $9 to $15 an hour. some people can get by quite handily on $9 or so an hour -- especially if they're willing to live outdoors or on a friend's couch -- but, generally speaking, the less jobs pay, the more of them you're going to need to get. suppose you're a parking lot attendant, a dishwasher or an office cleaner, and you earn only the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. if you have two children to support, your annual earnings will be $3,000 below the official poverty level for a family of three, so you'll need at least a part-time second job. not to mention the fact that you'll need to designate one of your children as a full-time baby sitter for the other. having worked in several low-paid jobs myself, i get a little nervous when people start throwing around the word jobs unmodified by adjectives such as decent-paying or good. what kind of jobs are we talking about? are we talking about jobs with union-style wages and benefits or big-box mcjobs that come with the assumption that you'll qualify for food stamps? between 1998 and 2000, while doing research for my book nickel and dimed: on (not) getting by in america, i worked as a waitress, a maid with a cleaning service, a nursing home aide and a walmart associate, with my pay averaging $7 an hour, or the equivalent of about $9 an hour in today's dollars. even when i managed to line up my schedule so i could work two jobs at a time, discretionary spending wasn't on the agenda -- not after gas, food and rent for a half-size trailer or a room in a shabby residential motel. fortunately, jobs were easy to find at the time, and the soaring dot-com economy wasn't depending on me. i know the argument: the more jobs there are, even low-paying, the more power workers have to demand higher wages, so wages will automatically rise. but in the late '90s, while employers were experiencing a labor shortage, hourly wages rose only slightly -- not because the law of supply and demand had been suspended, but because employers had become fiendishly efficient at preventing workers from organizing to demand higher wages. today, with the very concept of collective bargaining under political attack from the right, the chance that more jobs will mean better jobs has grown even slimmer. president barack obama promised -- just three years ago when he was in general a more promising sort of fellow -- that he would raise the federal minimum wage to $9.50 by 2011. maybe he forgot, just as he forgot his promise to press for the employee free choice act, which would have made it easier for workers to organize. or maybe he was intimidated by unemployment rates in excess of 9% and accepted the defeatist notion that any job -- no matter how low-paid, backbreaking or abusive -- is better than none. that's been the sad trajectory of the american middle-class spirit from the late '70s to the present day: we've gone from johnny paycheck's take this job and shove it to begging the sleek-suited job creators for whatever they can throw our way. fortunately there are some courageous exceptions to this idea. forty-five thousand verizon employees are walking picket lines to defend their hard-won union wages and benefits. thousands of walmart employees have signed up as members of an association ( our walmart ) to demand respect from the company. even the most isolated and invisible workers -- nannies and maids -- are organizing themselves into a national domestic workers alliance. as anyone in these groups could you tell: we don't just need more jobs, we need more jobs that treat employees like humans and pay what you could actually live on. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of barbara ehrenreich.

" the favorable tax treatment of employer-paid health insurance generates overconsumption of health care and contributes to rising health care costs. the benefits go mainly to middle- and upper-income households, since those without jobs get no employer-provided benefits. numerous loopholes for favored industries in the corporate tax code distort the market's investment decisions and reward the well-funded and politically connected. and it is not just the tax code that harms the economy while favoring the better off. excessive licensing requirements, permitting fees, restrictive examinations and other barriers to entry into medicine, law, plumbing, hair styling and many other professions are bad for economic productivity because they artificially restrict the supply of these services. and these barriers redistribute income perversely by raising incomes for those protected and raising prices for everyone. crony capitalism -- the special treatment of favored industries like autos -- runs counter to economic efficiency because it protects businesses that would otherwise fail, and it maintains high incomes for executives and shareholders. the too-big-to-fail doctrine, exhibited most recently in the tarp bailout of wall street banks, distorts efficiency by encouraging excess risk-taking. meanwhile, bailouts generate huge incomes for the lucky few who keep gains in good times and pass losses to taxpayers in bad times. in contrast to these and other policies, the one buffett criticizes -- low tax rates on capital income -- is beneficial for the economy, including lower-income households. economists agree broadly that an efficient tax system should avoid taxing income, dividends and capital gains to promote savings, investment and growth. tax rates on capital income should therefore be low or even zero. the u.s. is far from this ideal, especially given the high tax rate on corporate income and the additional taxation at the personal level. buffet asserts that taxing capital income has never deterred anyone from investing. well, then he has never discussed the issue with me or many of my friends. more importantly, taxing investment returns plays a huge role in what kinds of investments occur, and where, even if it has minor effects on the amounts. these tax-induced distortions in investment choices then reduce economic growth. high u.s. taxation on capital income drives investment overseas. so raising capital tax rates will not make the super-rich pay their fair share; it will encourage capital flight, driving factories and innovation abroad. the rich will still get their high returns, but u.s. workers will have fewer jobs and lower wages. buffett errs, most fundamentally, by focusing on outcomes rather than policies. the right question is which policies promote differences in incomes that reflect hard work, energy, innovation and creativity, rather than reward the unethical, the politically connected and the tax-savvy. in economics, as in sports, we should adopt good rules and insist that everyone play by them. then we should stand back and applaud the winners. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of jeffrey miron.

" in my state of michigan, we have districts where less than 10% of the students tested were deemed proficient in math. in the city where i live, less than 45% of the students passed reading . what do we think is going to happen to our economy as the jobs of tomorrow become more technical and a large chunk of our work force can barely read? i have one idea -- detroit. the national institute for literacy found that nearly 47% of the motor city's adults are functionally illiterate. not surprisingly, detroit's unemployment is near 12%, and the city is the country's poorest metropolis according to the census. and this correlation between academic achievement and poverty can be seen nationwide. four of our poorest states had four of the lowest act composite scores -- mississippi, tennessee, kentucky and arkansas. conversely four of our richest states had four of the highest test results -- massachusetts, connecticut, new hampshire and new jersey. programs such as no child left behind started in a good place but when school funding, bonuses and jobs hinge on scores, of course there's going to be a temptation to cheat. president barack obama's race to the top tried to address some of nclb's problems but its success is tripped up by the poverty line as well. in may obama gave the commencement speech at rttt winner booker t. washington high school in memphis, tennessee. two months later, the city's school board voted to delay starting school indefinitely because it didn't have enough money to open doors. memphis, like detroit , is one of our poorest cities. and this is not just an inner-city problem; not when 80% of the country is sharing less than 20% of the wealth. the less money people are making, the less tax revenue that's available to help fund schools. what we need is an aggressive, multipronged strategy geared toward closing the education gap between the rich and everyone else because everyone else -- in the spirit of the wall street bailouts -- is too big to fail. instead of dangling federal dollars like a carrot that some disadvantaged educators feel they must falsify test scores to obtain, how about the education department uses that money to work with some of the wall street companies we bailed out to establish paid internships for promising high school students? it would be better to use money from the education department to subsidize a tax break for professionals in careers such as engineering who tutor a certain number of hours a school year. when u.s. basketball won bronze in 1988, you would've thought the world used the american flag to wipe mud off its shoe by the way we responded. yet our education system continues to slip in the world ranking, and i don't see a teachers-of-the year dream team or a super committee made of top business leaders to help address this very real crisis. when the world was less competitive, we could afford to let the rich send their kids to private school and allow the rest of us to scramble the best we could. but technology has made the world smaller and college admission and job hiring is more cutthroat. today the education of our youth is no longer somebody else's problem -- because kids who lag behind grow into adults and a work force that lags behind. and an inferior work force competing against the best in the world is everybody's problem. so if less than gold wasn't acceptable for us in basketball, why do we continue to accept less than bronze with our kids' education? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of lz granderson.

" in iraq, much the same is true of nuri al-maliki and the iraqi government. most recently, maliki coddled the syrian regime in the midst of its crackdown and, for the past few years, has moved ever closer to iran and mahmoud ahmadinejad. meanwhile, the iraqi constitution also states, no law may be enacted that contradicts the established provisions of islam. in egypt, we helped push hosni mubarak out of office, and today it appears the muslim brotherhood is likely to gain a large number of seats in parliament this fall , while the new egypt has already restored relations with iran and helped broker a hamas-plo alliance. so what will come next in libya? it is a sign of our failed intelligence operations that we do not have a good grasp of who and what constitutes the opposition there. but there is credible evidence that true democrats constitute only a minority of the opposition. additionally, the drafted constitution for the new libya states that islam will be the religion of the state and the principal source of legislation is islamic jurisprudence (sharia). one early test of the new libya will be the disposition of abdel basset ali megrahi, the libyan terrorist responsible for blowing up pan am flight 103, and whether he will be extradited to the united kingdom or the united states. he was freed from prison in the uk two years ago and has been living freely in libya ever since. but the true test of all the uprisings we have seen this year, from egypt to syria to libya, is not exclusively about what happens in those countries but whether the united states will finally get morally serious about promulgating a consistent foreign policy toward them. right now, there is no plausible explanation as to why we would push mubarak out, while we held our counsel during iran's uprising. there is no plausible explanation as to why we would activate nato against libya, while we coddled syria for so long (including sending an ambassador to damascus and saying positive things about the assad regime.) not all of our mistakes are president obama's doing. it is worth recalling that while americans have universally heralded the end of the gadhafi regime based on his reign of terror and brutality, it was president bush who restored diplomatic relations with libya and took it off the state sponsors of terrorism list. but, just now, as we cheer what looks like the mad dog's fall, let us recall, as shakespeare put it: the worst is not, so long as we can say 'this is the worst.' that is sadly, likely, the case in egypt. let us retool and rethink so such will not happen again elsewhere. it is long past time for a moral consistency, it is long past time for a better intelligence apparatus throughout the middle east where the cia needs to lift its game, and it is long past time we instruct our putative and potential allies in the virtues and principles of the kinds of revolutions that do not devour their own children. that starts with, but does not end with, one of the most esteemed precepts of our nation's own founding -- the separation of church and state. a revolutionary regime basing its law on the precepts of islam, or a country where the muslim brotherhood is poised to take more and more power, is simply not what we should be promoting. nor are such organizations of power in the interest of the oppressed, who truly do want genuine freedom. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of william bennett.

" the effects of plate tectonics are felt much more strongly in regions that are close to plate boundaries, such as california or japan, but the east coast of the united states can experience smaller events, situated as it is essentially in the middle of a tectonic plate -- the north american plate. the ice sheet/glacier explanation is perhaps slightly more widely accepted, but in either case we are talking about very small motions of the earth that result in relatively rare earthquakes. in fact, these earthquakes on the east coast occur so rarely that it is very difficult for earth scientists to identify specific faults that are active, that is, ones where over time we would expect significant earthquakes to occur. if we were able to go back in time and record earthquakes in this region over many thousands of years, we would probably see that some areas had fairly regular earthquake activity, and we could then come up with a more solid explanation. in fact, that is what many people in the scientific community are trying to do -- they can't go and get the sorts of records that we receive from seismic instruments today, but they can go look for evidence of shaking in the past that tells us that there was a large earthquake in a specific region at a particular time. this is called paleoseismology and is a very powerful tool when combined with observations of current earthquakes. cnn: i thought earthquakes were a west coast phenomenon. aren't these relatively rare here? lohman: yes, they are rarer but result in relatively higher levels of shaking. the west coast is a much more active region, with earthquakes, volcanoes and high rates of deformation overall and with a relatively warm, squishy young crust compared with the old, cold rock material underneath the east coast. this means that the seismic waves that radiate outward from an earthquake in california are absorbed much more and are not felt as strongly as they would be for a similar earthquake here on the east coast. scientists often say that the east coast rings like a bell after an earthquake, with the seismic waves remaining strong over long distances, whereas in california the seismic waves are absorbed relatively quickly, so their effect is more like the thud you'd hear if you rang a wooden bell. cnn: what's the risk for tsunami? lohman: there does not appear to be a risk for a tsunami from this earthquake at this particular time. one potential source would be if the shaking caused an offshore landslide -- and there is no evidence of that here. if the conditions are right, landslides can cause quite damaging tsunamis. this primarily depends on how large the landslide is and how quickly it moves. if the landslide moves slowly, then it doesn't transmit a lot of energy to the water, and we don't get a significant tsunami. cnn: is the magnitude 5.2 earthquake that struck colorado on monday night related to this quake? lohman: there isn't any indication of that right now, but that is certainly something people will look at. cnn: when was the last time we had an earthquake on this side of the country? what happened? lohman: there have been quite a few large earthquakes on the east coast, although since many of them occurred before we had the types of modern seismic instrumentation that we have today, it is difficult to determine their exact size. there was one in 1897 very close to the location of today's event, in western virginia, and there have been large earthquakes near boston, charleston (south carolina) and other cities several times a century in the past that caused damage to churches, chimneys and other tall structures at the time. much smaller events, of the order magnitude 3 to 4, occur many times a year on the east coast, but are usually only felt by the people who are directly on top of them. for reference, a magnitude 4 is about 33 times smaller than a magnitude 5, and 1,000 times smaller than a magnitude 6. cnn: what's the risk for structures here? like high-rises, nuclear power plants, reservoirs, water and transportation systems? lohman: when engineers discuss risk and hazard from earthquakes, they tend to need to know quantities that are quite difficult for earth scientists to provide. earth scientists try to convert our understanding of how frequent earthquakes are likely to occur on a particular fault into numbers that reflect, for example, how likely it is that a particular spot will experience a given amount of shaking within the next 50 years. these are shown as probability of exceedance maps that allow structural engineers to determine the appropriate building codes that should be used for public structures, as well as private ones, in an area. since we have less information about earthquakes on the east coast (since they don't occur as often), we've had to incorporate that uncertainty into our estimates. so the seismic hazard maps you can find online through the united states geological survey hazards program reflect our understanding about all the faults we know about as well as an attempt to account for the ones we aren't aware of. cnn: is the east coast ready for an earthquake? lohman: that's a question for a different kind of scientist or engineer. from what i saw today, the public response appeared to be very well-coordinated and appropriate. sensitive facilities were shut down for further inspection, and agencies such as the usgs got information out to the public very rapidly. this is a very good time for people to think about their own preparedness for any natural disaster, however. it's a good time to go through your house and make sure that your bookcases are attached to the walls (which is a good thing to do anyway) and that you have some emergency supplies and water on hand.

" reagan, the former actor, was perfect for a time when politics was more scripted. even in a supposed unscripted debate, he could prepare and perfectly deliver a line like, there you go again. palin must compete at a time when coverage is more constant and less formal. she has wisely, for example, taken to facebook and twitter, confident the press will pick up whatever she writes. what is most reaganesque about sarah palin, however, is that on camera, her optimism about america appears natural. this is a quality that should not be underestimated, since it allows her the leeway to be negative without turning off voters by appearing mean-spirited. this offers at least the possibility that, despite her current low standing in the polls, she will be able to leap-frog over the more negative sounding bachmann and perry, and compete head-to-head with romney. even more than they did in 2008, americans want hope. what palin's handlers have in the former governor is a candidate they can cast in a pitch-perfect media campaign that blends a criticism of the obama administration with a positive message about the future. i am not saying palin will be the president someday, or will even secure the republican nomination. if the voting in either contest were held today, she would lose. it is very dangerous, however, to count out a candidate like palin before she has had a chance to campaign. recall that, back in january 1980, before he had even secured the republican nomination, an abc news poll had reagan trailing carter by 30 points. at the very end of the palin video, there is a shot of a bear rising up on its hind legs. the camera angle, a somewhat silhouetted view looking up a hill, is right out of another 1984 reagan commercial, the so-called bear in the woods spot. in the reagan ad, the bear stood for the former soviet union. now, the not-so-subtle reference is to the momma grizzly from alaska. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of paul sracic.

" each time we run it, we feed it a slightly different but equally plausible estimate of the current state of the atmosphere, given that our observations are few, far between and imperfect. in each case, we get a different answer; the differences are typically small to begin with but can grow rapidly so that by a week or so, the difference between any two forecasts is as great as the difference between any two arbitrary states of the weather at that time of year. no point in going any further! but we observe that sometimes and in some places, the differences grow slowly, while at other times and places, they may grow much more rapidly. and by using different computer models, we can take into account our imperfect understanding of the physics of the atmosphere. by these means, we can state with some accuracy how confident we are in any particular forecast for any particular time and place. today, one of the greatest challenges faced by weather forecasters is how best to convey their estimates of forecast confidence to the public. ideally, we would like to be able to say with full scientific backing something like the odds of hurricane force winds in new york city sometime between friday and sunday are 20%. we have far to go to perfect these, but probabilistic statements like this are the best for which we can hope. we know from experience that everyone will deal with such probabilistic forecasts in their own way: people have a very broad range of risk aversion. but the next time you are inclined to criticize weather forecasters for assigning probabilities to their forecasts, remember this essay and consider how much better off you are than with other types of forecasters you rely on. your stockbroker, for example. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of kerry emanuel.

" ten years ago, if you had told knowledgeable global observers that hosni mubarak and moammar gadhafi would be toppled from their dictatorial perches within the same year, they probably would have chuckled in your face. but this democracy renaissance across the middle east and north africa became possible only through the grass-roots, democratic mobilization that we have seen on the streets of tunis, cairo and tripoli over the last few months. with neighboring countries like yemen, bahrain and syria in the midst of similar pro-democracy uprisings, the possible falling of each dictatorial domino within the region should give much hope to the men and women of the middle east who yearn for a brighter future for their daughters and granddaughters. with their own berlin wall moments, young people across religious, sectarian and ethnic lines are helping to build their undemocratic arab nations into societies that forgo the dictatorial treachery of the past for the hopeful politics of the future. thomas jefferson once said: i hope our wisdom will grow with our power, and teach us, that the less we use our power, the greater it will be. let us pray that, in a region of the world fraught with cults of megalomaniacal personalities who have spent the better part of the last 50 years oppressing, torturing and marginalizing their own people, pro-democracy movements will inspire people to keep up their efforts to bring political change to syria, yemen and bahrain. this arab spring could turn into an arab year that the whole world can celebrate together. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of arsalan iftikhar.

" jobs had the same vision and ambition -- to bring technology to the masses -- in every year that followed. in 1984, the macintosh ( mac ) first made graphical computing accessible and kicked off the cult of mac. jobs' sway on technological products has become near universal. they are no longer niche products. like the telephone or the automobile, we all use computers -- for work, for play, to create and to communicate. his influence is likely to become even greater. the iphone and ipad are setting the stage for a new generation of truly personal mobile computers. it's not hard to imagine that one day everyone will have one (or at least a cheap knockoff). as with the pcs that came before them, these products are showing the rest of the industry how it's done. they are easy and intuitive to use. they have a delightful magic. and all this comes from a hippie kid who had the ambition to put a dent in the universe and the vision that technology had to be easy enough for even kids to use. look around. jobs' products have become universal, like the automobile or the telephone. he's the most important innovator of our times, and his resignation is a great loss. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of leander kahney.

" work permit immigration plan raises false hopes by ruben navarrette jr ., cnn contributor story highlights ruben navarrette: obama's plan to issue work permits to some facing deportation is confusing it's meant to help the worthy and get criminals out, but details are hard to come by, he says progressives think it means reprieves; conservatives call it a back-door amnesty, he writes navarrette: policy tries to be tough and compassionate at the same time but won't do much editor's note: ruben navarrette jr. writes a weekly column for cnn.com and is a nationally syndicated columnist. san diego (cnn) -- how cruel can the obama administration be to illegal immigrants, as well as to their families and supporters? this cruel: for the sake of politics, it offers false hope to the desperate. it takes a meager offering and a minor tweaking of immigration policy, dresses it up with bows and ribbons and bills it as part of a grand 21st century immigration system. but because the administration can't be pinned down on specifics as to how the new policy will work, no one can tell whether this is one step forward -- or two steps back. and how desperate are many illegal immigrants in the united states to get a simple work permit -- not citizenship mind you, just a slip of paper allowing them to pick avocados, milk cows, clean horse stalls, clean windows atop skyscrapers, slaughter cattle or do any other dirty and dangerous job that most americans won't do for any amount of money? this desperate: having heard that the obama administration would suspend deportations and issue work permits for some facing deportation, some illegal immigrants are reportedly thinking of turning themselves in to immigration officials so they can work legally in the united states. the bizarre revelation comes courtesy of univision anchor jorge ramos who -- along with producers of the network's sunday morning talk show al punto -- did a phenomenal job of separating myth from reality in discussing the new changes in the administration's immigration policy. ramos told viewers that he had received, via twitter, many inquiries asking whether the undocumented should allow themselves to get arrested so they could have a shot at getting a work permit. look, i'm the son of a retired cop who spent 37 years on the job and someone who supports deporting illegal immigrants as long as we don't outsource immigration enforcement to local police and handle the process according to the rules. so i could make the argument that illegal immigrants should turn themselves in to law enforcement, or for that matter go home on their own, because it's the right thing to do. but they shouldn't do it because they expect to get something in return from the obama administration. in trying to be both tough and compassionate, team obama has made complete hash of its immigration policy. one minute, obama is insisting that he supports comprehensive immigration reform; the next, he is doubling down on the failed strategy of enforcement only. last week, it was announced that the department of homeland security would review about 300,000 deportation cases in the pipeline to see whether any of those individuals should stay here and be given a work permit. it'll be done on a case-by-case basis, and the administration hasn't provided any details on how it will work. officials will say that the groups most likely to benefit are military veterans, their spouses and so-called dreamers -- college students who might have been eligible for legal status under the dream act if five senate democrats hadn't scuttled the bill in december. the administration claims to be exercising prosecutorial discretion and focusing resources on the removal of criminals who -- after committing the civil infraction of violating immigration laws -- graduated to committing actual crimes such as robbery, rape, assault or other serious offenses. and yet, in march, during a town hall meeting for the spanish-language television network univision, obama insisted that deportations of noncriminals were down and that he wanted young people who are undocumented but doing all the right things to succeed. he also said that despite calls for him to use his executive power to exempt certain groups from deportation, including college students, he could do no such thing because it would not conform with my appropriate role as president. so basically, the obama administration is doing what the president claimed that branch of government didn't have the power to do and stopping the deportation of people who he implied were never really in much danger of being deported in the first place. then the extremists in both camps get hold of an issue like this, and they twist the facts even more to advance their agendas. the left hopes for the best and assume that the administration was ending all deportations and handing out millions of reprieves. the right fears the worst and jumps to the conclusion that the administration was handing out mass deportation waivers and pushing through a silent amnesty. calm down, folks. neither scenario is true. some people are likely to benefit from the new rules. in fact, some already have. but, the number of beneficiaries isn't going to be very big. two reasons: first, at least for now, the only people who are eligible for this special dispensation are the 300,000 people in federal custody; the changes don't apply to anyone who might be apprehended in the future. second, if you're in custody but you're not a member of one of three groups -- a dreamer, a military veteran or the spouse of a veteran -- chances are you're not going anywhere. except to your country of origin. nothing wrong with that. these people are here illegally, and deportation is often the appropriate punishment. however, there is something wrong with an administration that by refusing to give details on its new policy raises false hopes and plays with people's lives. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of ruben navarrette jr.

" just the way people who live in the eastern united states prepare for hurricanes, storms and terrorist attacks, the region needs to become earthquake-ready. this could save their lives at home, in another part of the country or the world. in 2004, tilly smith, a 10-year-old girl from england vacationing in indonesia, saved countless lives because she had learned in school about tsunamis, recognized the natural warning signs and, with her mother, guided people to safety. earthquake and tsunami education and preparedness is important for all, everywhere. just as individuals need to prepare, local, state and federal government officials need to perform earthquake hazard assessments to determine and enforce building codes and take other measures to protect lives and property. as we saw on tuesday, earthquakes can and will strike at any moment. we can't afford to let their infrequency lull us into inaction. this earthquake was a wake-up call. the opinions in this commentary are solely those of christa von hillebrandt-andrade.

" it was effective because it was collaborative. the united states used diplomacy, working with its allies at the united nations to pass u.n. resolution 1973, which provided international consensus for the u.s. role. further support came from the arab league, which endorsed the effort to protect libyan civilians. instead of bearing the cost of the conflict, the united states smartly assumed an early leadership role and then transferred responsibilities to our nato partners. multilateralism proved effective once again. it was wise to limit the size and scope of u.s. involvement. u.n. resolution 1973 prohibited the use of ground forces, which minimized mission creep. the libyans wanted limited air support and supplies, not an international ground war. we were a cooperative partner within an important arab and muslim country. the united states showed the benefit of a foreign policy that supports national movements working for democracy. we cannot impose change, but we can bolster emerging efforts for positive reform. the success of the revolution belongs to the libyan people. while nato performed admirably, it was the libyan people who fought, died and freed their country of gadhafi. regular people -- mechanics, doctors, street vendors -- joined the fight, sacrificing everything for the promise of a better country. we should continue to play a supportive role, but it is up to libyans to build their future. the end of gadhafi's dictatorship gives fresh momentum to the arab spring, which has become more uncertain since the revolutions in tunisia and egypt. gadhafi's exit is an essential prelude to the democratic transition we all hope to see in libya. this is the beginning of that transition, not the end. just as the united states supported gaddafi's ouster, it must also support libya as it begins to lay the foundations of democracy. finally, the events in libya should remind us of obama's speech in cairo in june 2009, where he framed a new vision of the u.s. role in the middle east. some members of congress have been critiquing the president on libya, but he provided an effective foreign policy framework that should be continued. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of keith ellison.

" almost is an important characterization because, in fact, historically, the most recent hurricanes hitting the east coast -- hugo (1989) and fran (1996) for example -- have been urban renewal projects. small beach cottages, destroyed or damaged, are replaced by larger buildings and sometimes even high rises. and the new buildings are placed on property that is now more susceptible to storms than before because the shoreline is closer and the dunes are gone. recognizing the futility (and stupidity) of rebuilding in very dangerous places, the states of north carolina and south carolina both instituted policies of not allowing buildings in beach communities to be replaced if destroyed by storms. property owners went to court, important people were offended, politicians got into the mix and the approach did not work in either state. when will we ever learn as the song goes. why spend federal and state money to bring back roads, water and sewer lines, bridges and beaches in locations where we know for certain that storms occurred in the past and will soon occur again in the future; storms that will destroy the communities. how long will it take the public to learn that beachfront construction is a fool's act and that we should not be responsible for such foolish acts. ironically, although the affected beachfront property owners may lack common sense, they do not lack for money and influence, which of course is one reason that we repeatedly bail them out. after hurricane irene the time may come to take a deep breath and in this era of tight budgets, ask why are we bailing these people out once again? those who study global change argue that more intense storms are on the way along with a rising sea level. no better time than now to come to our senses. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of orrin h. pilkey.

" congress will then have until december 23 to vote on the proposal, with no amendments permitted. a simple majority on the panel -- seven of 12 members -- is needed to approve whatever package it comes up with, meaning that it will take a lone member of either party to push something through by voting with the other side. the committee's proposal would then need a simple majority in each chamber of congress to make it to president barack obama's desk. if the committee fails to reach agreement or congress fails to pass whatever package is recommended, a trigger mechanism would enact further across-the-board cuts in government spending, including for the military. in our capacity as co-chairmen, we are engaging in serious discussions to determine what set of rules will govern the committee's operation, examining a schedule of potential meetings and exploring how to build a committee staff that will help us achieve success, said the murray-hensarling statement. it added that most of the committee members are reviewing deficit reduction work of the past few years, when a deficit reduction commission appointed by obama and a group of six u.s. senators came up with similar plans calling for spending cuts, tax reform and changes to entitlement programs such as social security and medicare. earnest told reporters that congress faces tough choices in coming up with a deficit reduction plan, regardless of the size of the package. so if there is an opportunity for us to do something even bigger than $1.5 trillion, i think you can make a pretty good argument that doing something bigger is actually something that many members of congress would find easier to support and vote for than something smaller, earnest said. months of rancorous negotiations on deficit reduction have failed to resolve a fundamental dispute between republicans and democrats involving the size of government and whether to raise revenue while cutting spending. obama is pushing for a comprehensive plan that includes spending cuts, increased tax revenue and entitlement reforms, while republicans seek to shrink government by proposing spending cuts and entitlement reforms without increased revenue. an impasse over the tax revenue issue led to the debt ceiling agreement, which imposed the initial round of spending cuts and set up the special committee to work out further deficit reduction. the agreement also enables the federal debt ceiling to be increased through 2012, allowing the government to borrow what it needs to meet its obligations. the brinkmanship of the negotiations, with uncertainty over whether the government might default if no deal is reached, was one reason that ratings agency standard poor's downgraded the u.s. credit rating from aaa to aa-plus earlier this month. cnn's ted barrett and tom cohen contributed to this report.

" (cnn) -- judy flanagan's phone rang tuesday with a call the arizona immigration attorney wasn't expecting. a federal prosecutor suggested one of her clients -- a 22-year-old university student with no criminal record -- should ask to have her deportation case dismissed. that's never happened before, flanagan said. immigration lawyers around the country hope those types of calls from federal officials will become more common under new deportation guidelines the obama administration detailed a week ago. the department of homeland security said the government would review about 300,000 deportation cases pending in federal immigration courts. lower-priority cases -- those not involving individuals considered violent or otherwise dangerous -- would be suspended under the new criteria. federal authorities are still hashing out the details of how the cases will be reviewed, a senior department of homeland security official said thursday. because the working group is in the midst of designing the process for reviewing cases, no individual cases have been administratively closed or otherwise affected by the policy announced last week, said the official, who asked to remain anonymous per departmental policy. but some immigration attorneys say they're already starting to see a difference in how their clients are treated. a day after the guidelines were announced, georgia attorney charles kuck argued in court that his clients' cases should be dropped under the new guidelines. the clients -- two teens with no criminal records who police arrested during traffic stops -- were released from a detention center on tuesday, kuck said. these kids were detained for months. we had previously asked for their release numerous times, he said. it was only after the memo came out that they were released. but how widespread the policy's impact will be on the local level remains unclear. we are seeing different things in different places, said eleanor pelta, president of the american immigration lawyers association. some attorneys say they're seeing more cases administratively closed, pelta said, but others say local immigration officers have told them they need more guidance from the federal government before they can change course. homeland security secretary janet napolitano's letter announcing the case-by-case review last week followed a june memo from immigration and customs enforcement (ice) director john morton, which also urged prioritizing cases through prosecutorial discretion. the spirit of the announcement (last week) was, 'we're really serious about this,' pelta said. administration officials call it a matter allocating scarce resources more efficiently. critics call it backdoor amnesty, a way to push through policy changes that conservatives in congress would never agree to. the obama administration has resorted to implementing its plans via executive fiat, arizona gov. jan brewer said last week. brewer signed a state law last year requiring local law enforcement in arizona to apprehend and help deport illegal immigrants, among other things. the u.s. justice department sued, arguing that only the federal government has that authority. earlier this year, a three-judge appeals court panel sided with federal officials and against brewer. federal judges have also blocked similar measures in utah, indiana and georgia. and the nationwide skirmish between state and federal officials over who controls immigration enforcement has showed no signs of slowing. a federal judge heard arguments wednesday challenging an alabama measure aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration that is scheduled to go into effect september 1. but some say the new federal guidelines could undercut the state initiatives. it will make them meaningless, because even if georgia goes ahead and arrests every 18-year-old kid for driving without a license, ice is likely to release them back into the community, kuck said. in the meantime, many members of immigrant communities are confused about how the new guidelines will affect them. the american immigration lawyer association issued an advisory after napolitano's announcement, warning that the guidelines don't grant amnesty and don't create a program people can sign up to join. there is no 'safe' way to turn yourself in to immigration and there is no guarantee that your case will be considered 'low priority,' the advisory says. any person who comes into contact with immigration authorities may be arrested, detained or even removed. my phone lines have flooded because people are getting the wrong message. this is like the old game of telephone, said carolina antonini, an immigration attorney in georgia. antonini stressed that the new policy applies only to deportation cases already in the system, and how it will play out remains unclear. but even so, she said, it marks a significant change. the shift of mentality is important, she said, because it gives me the hope that at least i know people are going to be considered. there's a chance that everybody will be looked at as a human being before a blanket decision is made. but people on both sides of the immigration debate say the new guidelines don't fix america's immigration problems -- a fact napolitano acknowledged in her letter last week. the only way we're going to have a permanent solution that can't change depending on who's in the white house is for congress to take definitive action, pelta said. mark krikorian, executive director of the washington-based center for immigration studies, which favors stricter immigration control, said the guidelines showed the obama administration was abusing its power and shirking its responsibility to enforce immigration laws. this does, in fact, increase the incentive for states to try to act on their own, he said. cnn's alan silverleib contributed to this report.

" samantha eng writes for socialite life , a sister site of celebuzz . (cnn) -- mtv has long since moved away from being a music channel. just as video killed the radio star marked the ending of an era when mtv played its first music video on august 1, 1981 at 12:01 a.m., 30 years later, the success of the network's shows like the jersey shore have all but eclipsed the video star. so what's a musician striving to connect with fans and sell records to do? if you are lucky, you land an appearance on the video music awards. this sunday mtv will air the 2011 video music awards (aka the vmas) live, marking 27 years of a successful annual award show. last year's vmas boasted the highest ratings since 2002, bringing in 11.4 million viewers and making it the no. 1 cable telecast of 2010 for the mtv network. for musicians, the coveted spot has now become the performance slots during the award show. those selected have been identified as key players within the industry and to be asked has become an honor and acknowledgment of the music that an artist has put out that year. the musicians and mtv look to secure their audience base not through music videos, but by broadening the guest list, in particular the red carpet, to encompass all those within the mtv lineup from musicians, actors/actresses, celebrities and the reality stars that are the driving force of the network. so don't be surprised when the newest teen mom is standing next to the boys from the buried life on this year's pink carpet. that's because the true bread and butter of the network now is its reality shows. mtv's mega-hit, the jersey shore, has successfully followed eight dark haired and tan strangers -- nicole snooki polizzi, mike the situation sorrentino, jenni jwoww farley, paul pauly d delvecchio, ronnie ortiz-magro, sammi sweetheart giancola, and deena nicole cortese (replacing angelina pivarnick in season three) from the new jersey shores to most recently, florence, italy. the premiere episode of season four, following the cast overseas, broke the record for the largest audience for an mtv premiere with 8.8 million viewers, according to us magazine . now that's a reason to fist pump! in addition to the jersey shore, mtv currently has 10 reality shows in rotation. this does not include 11 other reality-based shows ranging from celebrity reality to competitive shows like america's next dance crew. with not much room for 4-minute music videos, mtv launched mtv2, a secondary channel dedicated to constant, commercial-free music videos. however, after two unsuccessful re-launches since its founding, mtv2 struggles to maintain the constant stream of music videos it proclaimed it would be dedicated to. the schedule now focuses the majority of music programming between the hours of 3:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. and has dubbed it amtv2. no wonder mtv decided to drop the music television tag line altogether in 2010 when it launched its official new logo -- though networks executives maintain that music is at the heart of all they do. it just happens to be smothered and covered by reality shows and scripted programming. so where does that leave the vma moon man in the race to the top? while the categories honored at the vmas still include video of the year, best new artist, best video in the hip-hop, pop or rock genres and many others, the award show has become a celebration of the mtv family of programming and of the youth that it entertains. musicians are merely hoping to secure their presence in that market by attending.

" ( people.com ) -- rose mcgowan's first nine years were anything but traditional. they were spent in the children of god sect, a group that extolled the virtues of free love and prepared for the second coming of jesus. although it proved a harrowing experience -- she fled with her family, she says, once the cult began advocating child-adult sexual relations -- as the setting at first was really idyllic, remembers the actress, 38, who rose to fame on tv's charmed and now stars in conan the barbarian 3d. i grew up in pastoral settings -- specifically, the italian countryside, where her parent were members of the local branch of the children of god. but mcgowan, who was born in florence, knew instinctively that she didn't belong in such a place. i've always been who i am, she says, explaining that while she did believe in god, she wasn't in accord with the hippie lifestyle, and certainly not with their aesthetic or the subservient role of females in the sect. even at her tender age, mcgowan rebelled. i did not want to be like those women. there were basically there to serve the men sexually, she says. prince william kate's bargain date night when her father began to fear that rose might be molested, she says, my dad was strong enough to realize that this hippie love had gone south. she fled the children of god with her father and siblings and moved to the u.s. mcgowan recalls that it was not an easy assimilation into the mainstream way of life. my brothers and sisters, we thought everyone was boring. emma stone is subject of video love letter by jim carrey many years later, she returned to the small town in italy with her then-boyfriend, rocker marilyn manson. we created quite a stir, she admits. looking back at her early experiences, mcgowan deflects with humor some of the dangers and difficulties she faced. in contrast to the dressed-down hippie look of the cult, she says, i came out of the womb waving red lipstick. still, the remembrances left quite an impression. while expressing gratitude to her father, who died in 2008, mcgowan tears up. mostly, though, she realizes the experience is all she ever knew and made her who she is. photos: emma stone's stylish summer looks there are people who will read this story and think i had a strange existence, she says. i think they've had a strange existence! see full article at people.com. 2010 people and time inc. all rights reserved.

" (cnn) -- robert e. howard's pulp warrior gets a new face in the form of baywatch and game of thrones graduate jason momoa in the new conan the barbarian. this loud and proudly primitive r-rated movie is definitely not for the squeamish. in the opening sequence, baby conan is carved out of his mortally wounded mother's womb by his father's blade as a battle rages all around them. before he's reached puberty the young whippersnapper is collecting his enemies' heads the way other boys collect baseball cards. for a while there you might think that conan the psychopath would be a more appropriate moniker. to be fair, there's not much point in doing a conan movie if you're going to pull your punches. bear that in mind as our hero shoves his thumb in the gaping hole where one adversary's nose used to be and squeezes, or when he ties another minion to a catapult and sends him flying back to his master, the shadow lord khalar zym ( avatar heavy stephen lang). the sadism is unpleasant, but you get what you pay for. director marcus nispel has a well-earned reputation as a remake specialist with a knack for clobbering the life out of the source material (his versions of the texas chainsaw massacre, pathfinder and friday the 13th are all inferior to the originals). but conan the barbarian has little in common with its namesake, the self-consciously mythic 1982 movie penned by john milius and oliver stone, and taken on its own terms -- as a kind of ultimate fighting dark age fantasy -- it has a certain sledgehammer pragmatism. momoa is at least as competent an actor as arnold schwarzenegger was when he first played the part in the early 1980s, and he looks like he could punch out a horse. but no matter how hard he glowers or how many heads he breaks, he's not half the barbarian arnie was. when schwarzenegger spoke, you had to pick through a dense thicket of umlauts. he was a natural born teuton. momoa has a rich, dark honey of a voice that sounds like swaying palm trees and cool vibes. even when he's shutting down his monk girlfriend's angst-y philosophizing with a curt i live, i love, i slay -- i am content (easily the movie's most memorable line), he can't quite disguise that empathetic laid back jack johnson surfer dude underneath. or maybe it's just the sarong he wears around his waist. in the fashion stakes momoa is easily upstaged by rose mcgowan's valley girl witch, teetering uncertainly on stacked rubber heels in a succession of cut-off i dream of jeannie outfits. she's dressed for the arabian nights, but the film was shot in romania. have they heard of hypothermia in hyboria? mcgowan also gets a freddy kruger-style steel glove and camp-scary hair, enough schlock value to make mincemeat of rachel nichols' woefully blank heroine, despite mcgowan's obvious unease in her gloomy computer-generated surroundings. the story? there isn't much: conan dedicates his life to tracking down the man who turned his father into a lava lamp (and foolishly let the son live). that would be khalar zym, of course, whose lackeys see to it that our barbarian always has his hands full. with its pointless 3-d, a prologue narrated by (who else?) morgan freeman, thudding direction and horrible acting, conan doesn't have a lot going for it -- only sheer bloody-mindedness and another gory battle every three minutes.

" angel laws is the editor in chief and creator of concreteloop.com . august 25 marks the tenth anniversary of the death of singer and actress, aaliyah. (cnn) -- it's been a decade since the tragic death of r b star and budding actress aaliyah dana haughton. just 22 years old at the time of her death, she was in the bahamas heading back to the states after wrapping up her 2001 music video, rock the boat. the twin-engine plane crashed shortly after takeoff. aboard were aaliyah and eight others -- including her hair stylist, eric forman, makeup artists anthony dodd and christopher maldonado, security guard scott gallin, video producer douglas kratz, blackground records employees keith wallace and gina smith, and the pilot, luis morales iii. in an instant their lives and aaliyah's promising career were gone. born in brooklyn and raised in detroit, she quickly garnered a fan base in the early '90s with her original take on r b music. working with industry greats like missy elliott, timbaland, r. kelly and more, she topped the charts with a slew of hits, including back forth, age ain't nothin' but a number, are you that somebody and we need a resolution . aaliyah's standout fashion sense made her a hot commodity among the fashion crowd: she modeled for tommy hilfiger, who showcased her tomboy appeal -- baggy jeans and a tight-fitting shirt -- and was featured on the covers of many magazines with that trendsetting hair swoop over her left eye. her influence on the music game is still relevant today. she has inspired artists from singer-rapper drake to pop superstar beyonce. ciara, who is best known for her singing and dancing moves, has an aaliyah-inspired stage presence and dressing style. singer-songwriter tank, who worked closely with aaliyah on her last two albums, spoke with concrete loop earlier this year about where she would be right now if she were alive. she would be at the top and there would probably be a few people who wouldn't have careers, he said. if you think about it, she was already on top. at the time of her death, she had three top-selling albums under her belt, many nominations and awards and was slated to have a big role in the matrix reloaded and matrix revolution movies. she had just completed her work on the film, queen of the damned and was already being sought after for other movie roles. not to mention, she had a solid and loyal fan base. however, the rest of her journey to superstardom just wasn't meant to be. a month before her untimely death, aaliyah granted mtv's show diary behind-the-scenes access to her fast-paced life and said, i am truly blessed to wake up every morning to do something that i love; there is nothing better than that. she continued, everything is worth it -- the hard work, the times when you're tired, the times when you are a bit sad. in the end, it's all worth it because it really makes me happy. i wouldn't trade it for anything else in the world. i've got good friends, a beautiful family and i've got a career. i thank god for his blessings every single chance i get. so, on august 25, blast aaliyah's timeless music loud and remember her for being a trendsetting force in fashion and for helping to redefine and take r b music to another level.

" source: nicolas cage asked assistant to find his son before beating by alan duke , cnn weston cage was placed under a psychiatric hold after los angeles police responded to the incident tuesday. story highlights new: cage's lawyer confirms the actor sent an assistant to find his son new: it doesn't justify a deliberate, provoked attack, cage's lawyer says weston cage's former personal assistant is being investigated in the 20-year-old's beating former assistant asks public to suspend their judgment until all of the facts come to light los angeles (cnn) -- the bloody beating of nicolas cage's son on a hollywood sidewalk last week followed a search for the 20-year-old because the actor wanted to see his son before leaving town, a source with knowledge of the incident said. a lawyer for cage said he was looking for weston because he didn't have his cell phone and he wanted to get in touch with him to do some recording. cage's request that the man he paid to be his son's assistant locate his son doesn't justify what occurred, which was a deliberate, provoked attack where weston was in no condition to defend himself, cage attorney martin singer said monday. the younger cage asked los angeles police to investigate the assistant, kevin villegas, for the alleged assault, according los angeles police sgt. john gomperz. villegas was fired after the incident last week. weston cage was placed under a psychiatric hold after los angeles police responded to the incident tuesday, but he was released over the weekend. cell phone video posted online showed weston cage being repeatedly hit as he was pinned down on a sidewalk. he wanted kevin to leave, and what happened, at least three witnesses told me, there was a provocation, singer said. weston threw a weak kick. he put weston down on the floor, and he began a barrage of punches, 13 to 15 to the face. i deeply lament the incident that occurred between me and weston last tuesday, villegas said, and plead with the media and the public to suspend their judgment of the episode until all of the facts come to light. the violent incident came amid a dispute between weston cage's mother, christina fulton, and nicolas cage over how to deal with their son's psychological issues, which are outlined in legal document filed in fulton's lawsuit against cage. she said she put her acting career on hold for two decades to raise the child while cage, one of hollywood's highest-paid actors, pursued his career. fulton is suing cage over unpaid taxes and the hollywood home where she raised weston, and is seeking to regain legal control over her son, who court documents say suffers from a number of mental, psychological and physical ailments. he lived with fulton after she and cage, who were never married, split up when weston was a child. villegas was hired several years ago as weston cage's personal wrestling coach when he was in high school. he later became a personal assistant to nicolas cage to help with his son. because of a confidentiality agreement, i am limited in what i can share publicly on this matter, villegas said. i'm grateful that weston is getting the care that he needs and wish him all the best. villegas was following orders from nicolas cage to find and hold on to his adult son the afternoon of the incident, said the source, who asked not to be identified because of legal and confidentiality issues. the older cage's lawyer denied the actor asked the assistant to hold on to his son. he only wanted to have the younger cage call his father, singer said. the source disputed an initial report that the fight began when villegas told weston cage he could not order a certain item from a restaurant menu. fulton blames nicolas cage for what she said is her son's downward spiral since he turned 18 and left her legal guardianship. i do not want him with nicolas cage, fulton said. i do not want him in that care. that is not the care my son needs. weston cage, in a statement delivered through his father's lawyer friday afternoon, said that he did not want his mother to be involved in his care. i am an adult, weston cage said. i don't want to have anything to do with my mother. any problems that i have ever had is because of the relationship that i had with my mother. when fulton heard the quote, she called it an absolute disgrace, suggesting that cage's lawyer solicited a statement from her son while he was under a psychiatric hold at ronald reagan ucla medical center. my son is under a spell. he's under a trance, fulton said. weston would say whatever his dad wants him to say. fulton said it is nicolas cage's fault that their son is in a hospital. he had his chance, she said of the elder cage. he had his chance to make it right. my son had a healthy environment here. he had a system that was fantastic. i built that with myself and my team. she said she fired villegas three years ago, but nicolas cage rehired him, she said. nicolas cage, in a statement from his spokeswoman friday, called fulton's comments blaming him for his son's psychiatric troubles unfortunate and inappropriate. this is a time to focus only on giving love and full support to weston, not an opportunity to lay blame on his father, a man who loves his son very deeply, cage said. fulton said cage was rarely around for her son growing up, while she dealt with his medical and psychological issues. for 18 years, i raised weston so nicolas could go be nicolas cage, and go be a superstar, and he did, she said. so i raised this boy, 24/7, we were glued to the hip. after weston's 18th birthday, his father orchestrated his removal from her care by persuading the employees she hired to work for him and giving weston his own home and money, fulton said. they all go work with nicolas cage because he has the money and he has the bank account and he has the fame, and i don't, she said. weston's special needs were not being met without her, she said. my son right now has been under the care of nicolas, she said. that didn't work. it's very obvious it didn't work. it failed miserably, failed miserably. singer, cage's lawyer, said fulton's lawsuit against cage is her motivation for attacking her son's father. ms. fulton comments about mr. cage are absurd, and it's very unfortunate that she would lash out like this because her son does not want to have anything to do with her, singer said. this is clearly all about money for ms. fulton. fulton's lawyer said she would file for conservatorship of her son next week so she could ensure that he will get the care he needs when he is eventually released from the psychiatric hold. i'd like my son to be with his mom, where it worked, fulton said. i'd like my son to be in an environment where it worked. you know, 18 years of being successful, 18 years of watching my son respond to all the medical intervention that i have given him and all the support. why would you mess with that? why would you interfere with that? my son needs to be home.

" opensuse, which makes another linux desktop platform, and others have been choked by microsoft's strong monopoly on the desktop, said alan clark, an opensuse director. it's played out differently than i expected, to be honest, clark said. we made some progress, but nothing like anybody envisioned. yet, opensuse has a comfortable presence in the server market, clark said. linux is very much pervasive. it's everywhere. you can't even fly on an airplane; ... you can't use facebook; you can't buy a book from amazon, clark said, without running into linux. the cult of linux familiarity with linux became a crucial skill for budding software engineers and server caretakers as far back as the mid-1990s. when david bohnett sought a partner in his new web venture called geocities, resulting in one of the largest internet business deals ever when it went public and then was acquired by yahoo for $3.6 billion in 1999, his main criteria was an adeptness with linux programming, bohnett said in an interview. john rezner fit the description and shared in the pair's eventual fortune. torvalds, the brain behind linux, never seemed very interested in fortunes, according to people who know him. the reclusive programming wizard declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed by phone, though he talked openly through e-mail and appeared on stage last week at linuxcon in vancouver, canada. there, torvalds was treated like a celebrity. a lover of reclusive scientists, including sir isaac newton and albert einstein, he described the general reactions from linux fans as just odd. he wrote: sometimes it does get to be a bit overwhelming. clark, from opensuse, described a memorable meeting with torvalds. the first time he came to japan, seriously, it was like a rock star arrived, and i could kind of tell it was really overwhelming for him, clark said. he took it in stride. the linux faithful are predominantly male, often nerdy, with strong principles about collaborative development that translate to a belief in a less hierarchal, more cooperative society, according to interviews. for example, ubuntu's bacon has an android phone, which uses google's open-source software, because the ethical side of me feels like it's the right thing to do, he said. it's not just a product. it's an ethos. apple has tried to define its principles in advertising: artistic, noncorporate and able to think different. its brand has been adopted by millions of people. meanwhile, linux has maintained a devout but small following over the last two decades. the linux software is embedded in many millions of machines, but its ethos and the penguin logo that embodies it remain an underground movement. to let turk explain it, because he'd be more than happy to, his tattoo is like a secret handshake, waiting for someone to be able to recognize and reciprocate. every so often, at the gym or something, i'll run into someone who's like, 'that's the linux tattoo,' and there's a conversation, said turk, who now works for open-source software maker talend. it's always been something that the community feels like it owns. it's almost a little bit anti-establishment. the penguin doesn't stand a chance against the marketing of big firms. but that's great. it's good. it's ours.

" the beauty of mclaren's system is that it reduces the complexity of a racetrack into a circle so at the point of decision, presentation of the data is very simple, which allows the engineer in a very stressful environment to make the right strategic decision and also see the data in a very clear, crisp format, said tomlinson. for the last three years nats has been working with mclaren's engineers to map heathrow's taxiways and runways -- much as they do a formula one track. but now, says tomlinson, in place of a race strategist the system is operated by heathrow's air traffic control, and instead of a circle the airport's network of runways and taxi lanes are represented by a simple rectangle -- enabling planes to be guided around the airport with greater ease and accuracy once they've landed. the collaboration has been groundbreaking according to geoff mcgrath, managing director of mclaren applied technologies -- the f1 team's tech division. to my knowledge this is a first -- nats has invested in this because there is nothing like it available, he added. the system is now in its proof of concept stage and hopes are high that it will be used by airports around the world within a year. think in terms of the environmental benefits of that, enthused tomlinson. large airports with about 1300 to 1400 flights a day - if you save just one minute of taxi time per flight on average, that equates to one day's worth of taxi time - and that's how much we could save using mclaren's technology.

" (cnn) -- twitter's co-founders announced this week that they are throwing their money and support behind a new app called lift, which, according to a blog post that sounds like it was written by lost's dharma initiative, is an interesting new application for unlocking human potential through positive reinforcement. we love this software for what it does, and because we've tried it and it works. our plan is to build something extraordinary together, the post says. right. well. but what is lift, exactly? and what makes it so awesome that every tech blog on the planet is writing about it despite the fact the app is in alpha testing and isn't open to pretty much anyone. perhaps it's the fact that evan williams and biz stone , author of tuesday's aforementioned welcome-to-the-future announcement, are such rock stars in the tech world. this is the first investment for the obvious corporation (yes, that's the real name), which the twitter alums started this year. obvious' goal, as stated on its website -- which, obviously, is obvious.com -- is to make systems that help people work together to improve the world. the partnership between obvious and lift is more interesting than the scant details about the app itself, writes pascal-emmanuel gobry at the blog the silicon alley insider. readwriteweb, a tech blog, offers some analysis about what the new lift app may look like. in a word? it's like twitter. it sounds like twitter in its simplicity and from what i've seen it looks a lot like twitter too -- but with more structure, marshall kirkpatrick writes in a post on that site. what's called lift today was apparently called mibbles just weeks ago and was described then as 'a very simple tracking and encouragement tool.' williams and stone are funding lift, but the app's creators are jon crosby and tony stubblebine, who are also big names in the tech world. in a blog post called uplifting news about an obvious partnership , stubblebine writes that he and crosby do have a prototype of the app, but we're a long way from opening the doors to the public. our intention is to create a long-lived company. but unlike my last company, we're not set on doing this alone. enter obvious, he writes. techcrunch, another tech blog, did some digging in the code of the lift website and found a humorous clue about the app's future. hidden in the code is this statement: lift. achieve anything (assuming we finish building this app). robin wauters, the post's author, gives lift the benefit of the doubt: i assume they will (finish the app), he writes. can't wait to finally be able to achieve anything!

" jobs famously dropped out of oregon's reed college. but he later would say that a class he audited in calligraphy inspired apple's design aesthetic. he was booted from apple in 1985. but, while away from the company, he founded a company called next that developed an early version of what would become the revolutionary macintosh computer operating system. jobs chewed on these points during a speech in 2005. you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future, he said in a commencement address at stanford university. you have to trust in something -- your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. this approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life. all this adds up to people seeing jobs as an inspiration. it is truly the end of an era. thank you for inspiring us all steve, dave morin, founder of an app called path and a former apple and facebook employee, wrote on his google plus page on thursday morning. you've shown an entire generation what is possible with innovation, design, and focus. that kind of impact makes it difficult for anyone else to bring so much history and charisma to the company. in the short time since jobs' resignation, tech pundits have been writing that the first era of personal computing is over, since bill gates from microsoft and jobs are no longer in the business. there's much praise online for the new ceo of apple, tim cook, who has been the company's coo, essentially running it since jobs went on medical leave in january. a lot of attention is paid, in particular, to his business sense. at the atlantic, nicholas jackson writes that picking cook as the next ceo of apple is steve jobs' greatest creation . tim cook is not steve jobs, he writes. but he did learn from the best how to emulate him. and if he was going to fail, he already would have. cook has been acting ceo of apple since january, when jobs went on his third medical leave from the company. yes, it was that long ago. he presided over the latest mac refresh, over the launch of the ipad 2, over the announcement of the icloud, and even over that moment, about two weeks ago, when apple's market cap exceeded that of oil-services giant exxon, making it number one. but no one is arguing that cook will bring as much life to the tech world. fortune's miguel heft writes : like jobs, cook is a relentless executive and exacting boss, a perfectionist who obsesses over minute details. but the similarities between the two men end there. while jobs is a charismatic leader known for outbursts of temper, cook, who was raised in a small town in alabama, is soft-spoken, reserved and intensely private. and as jobs used his creative genius and vision to conceive and design blockbuster products like the imac, iphone and ipad, cook's considerable operational skills were focused on making sure that apple could build millions of those products and deliver them to every corner of the world to meet customers' seemingly insatiable demand. the washington post says it's unlikely (cook will) match the innovative momentum of his predecessor. finally, apple's product announcements -- which are treated like rock concerts by the plaid-shirt-and-big-glasses-wearing tech bloggers who get to attend them -- will be far less theatrical without jobs' presence. critics often talk disparagingly of the 'reality distortion field' generated by the apple boss: his ability to convince onlookers that technologies that would seem unformed in other hands have reached a peak of perfection at apple, the financial times wrote . generating this suspension of disbelief is essential to stirring up demand for gadgets most consumers had no idea they needed, and is an art form of which mr. jobs has long been the acknowledged master . cook's commencement address at auburn university last year gives some hints about his presentation skills. during the talk, a robe-wearing cook discussed his decision to come to apple at a time when the company was doing far worse than competitors. not only was compaq performing much better than apple, it was headquartered in texas, and therefore closer to auburn football, he said, trying to appeal to the presumably football-crazed audience. the response to his joke? an un-steve-jobs-like silence.

" the boxy beige macintosh sold well, but jobs clashed frequently with colleagues, and in 1986, he was ousted from apple after a power struggle. then came an 10-year hiatus during which he had high-profile successes (buying pixar animation studios from george lucas before they made it big with toy story ) and failures (founding next computer, whose pricey, cube-shaped computer workstations never caught on). in 1996 apple bought next, returning jobs to the then-struggling company he had co-founded. within a year, he was running apple again -- older and perhaps wiser but no less of a perfectionist. and four years after that, he took the stage to introduce the original ipod, the little white device that revolutionized portable music and kick-started apple's furious comeback. internet mourns jobs' resignation | ireport: share your thoughts i'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if i hadn't been fired from apple, he said at stanford in 2005. it was awful-tasting medicine, but i guess the patient needed it. sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. when it comes to apple, you pretty much know the rest. over the next decade, jobs wowed launch-event audiences, and consumers, with one game-changing hit after another: itunes (2003). the macbook (2006). the iphone (2007). the ipad (2010). observers marveled at his skills as a pitchman, his ability to inspire god-like devotion among apple fanboys (and scorn from pc fans) and his one more thing surprise announcements. time after time, he sold people on a product they didn't know they needed until he invented it. and all this on an official annual salary of $1. by the mid-2000s, however, jobs was having serious health problems. in 2004, he announced to his employees that he was being treated for pancreatic cancer. he lost weight and appeared unusually gaunt at keynote speeches to apple developers, spurring concerns about his health and fluctuations in apple's stock price. one wire service even accidentally published jobs' obituary. jobs, 56, who is married with four children, had a liver transplant in 2009 during a six-month medical leave of absence from apple. he took another medical leave in january this year. because of this, some observers said they weren't surprised by wednesday's news that jobs was stepping down as apple's ceo. read jobs' resignation letter there is a certain sort of sad inevitability to this moment, the times' nocera told cnn, adding that jobs wouldn't give up control of his company easily. apple is his life. he cares about it almost as much as he cares about his wife and children. according to the wall street journal, jobs once famously said, it's more fun to be a pirate than to join the navy. he even flew a pirate flag over his engineers' building while they were building the macintosh. but the reality is his once-renegade tech company, the david to microsoft's goliath, is long been part of the mainstream. apple has more than $70 billion in cash reserves and even briefly surpassed exxon mobil this month as the world's most valuable company. jobs doesn't give many interviews, especially about his personal life, and apple has been tight-lipped about his health. but perhaps mindful of his legacy, he has cooperated on his first authorized biography, scheduled to be published by simon schuster in november. i've done a lot of things i'm not proud of, such as getting my girlfriend pregnant when i was 23 and the way i handled that, jobs is quoted as saying in the promotional material for the book, being penned by walter isaacson. but i don't have any skeletons in my closet that can't be allowed out. by contrast, jobs has always spoken with immense pride about what he and his engineers have accomplished at apple. your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. and the only way to do great work is to love what you do, he told the stanford grads. if you haven't found it yet, keep looking. don't settle. as with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. and, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.

" those who follow apple know that cook has been an active contributor to apple's success in his role as chief operating officer. he has been credited with aggressively working to lower apple's hardware and gadget prices, and making deals with component suppliers in order to give apple an upper hand in the market. gamestop responds to deus ex controversy by pulling it from shelves in person, cook is gruff and assertive, but in a way that makes people feel secure -- this is no doubt part of the reason why apple has slowly been introducing cook to the public via apple keynotes over the last few years. in the public's eye, cook has become the riker to jobs' picard -- and people generally like riker. there may be no way to truly replace steve jobs, but apple knows that publicly supporting tim cook is, at the very least, good pr. copyright 2010 arstechnica.com "
" he then announces that he'll be introducing three revolutionary products of this class. the first one: a widescreen ipod with touch controls. second, a revolutionary mobile phone. the third, a breakthrough internet communications device. then, he grins as the icons for the three devices beginning spinning on the giant screen behind him until they nearly blur into one. are you getting it? jobs said. these are not three separate devices. this is one device. and we are calling it iphone. watch jobs' presentation unveiling the iphone in 2007. 2. welcome to the apple store the so-called experts thought a store that sold only one company's products was a bad idea. jobs, of course, disagreed. in a 2001 video shown to apple developers, ceo jobs strolls through the as-yet-unopened store in tyson's corner, virginia, that would be the first of more than 300 apple stores worldwide . jobs strolls around, showcasing then-novel features such as the genius bar and nooks for children's activities. with nary an ipod or iphone in sight (the ipod was launched in october that year, with the iphone following in 2007), jobs introduced the concept that the stores would be more than just retail space. literally half the store is devoted to solutions, jobs says in the video. because people don't just want to buy personal computers any more. they want to know what they can do with them. watch jobs' tour of the first apple store 3. the 'magical ipad' it was easy to mock the starry-eyed enthusiasm jobs displayed in january of last year when he unveiled a tablet computer called the ipad. extraordinary. gorgeous. unbelievably great. a dream. it's so much more intimate than a laptop, he said. this won't be a purchase, he suggested. this will be a relationship. of course, all the gadget went on to do was absolutely dominate the emerging tablet market. by some accounts, the ipad now holds about 90% of the tablet market. watch jobs give the ipad keynote presentation on january 27, 2010. or if you prefer, watch this edit that splices together all of the superlatives jobs and others used that day . 4. graduation jobs' 2005 commencement speech at stanford university was the rare instance when his public and private personas collided. it was rare enough for jobs to accept a public-speaking engagement. more surprising by half was that he used it to share some of the most personal details of his life. he began by stoking the flames on one of the famous details of his story -- that he was in the process of becoming one of the world's most famous college dropouts. this is the closest i've ever gotten to a college graduation, he laughed. he then goes on to talk about being given up for adoption when he was born, of leaving school in part because of the cost to his adoptive parents, and of dropping in on classes for a year-and-a-half after that. he later frankly discusses his diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and musings on death. your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life, he said. watch jobs' commencement speech. 5. tablet computers? what are those? this is one that's only fully appreciated as a performance in retrospect. at the all things d digital conference in 2007, a meeting of the tech titans happened when jobs and microsoft's bill gates sat down together for an interview. gates reveals that he carries a tablet computer around with him all the time. he calls the then-nascent gadgets the future of computing. i think you'll have a full-screen device that you carry around and you'll do dramatically more reading off of that, says gates. i believe in the tablet form factor ... and then you'll have the device that fits in your pocket. this was, of course, more than two years before apple's ipad would be unveiled, but it's hard to imagine jobs and company didn't already have it in the works. the first time the word tablet is mentioned, jobs swivels in his chair and appears to literally bite his lip. the first words jobs says about the future of computers? the pc has proved to be very resilient. he eventually allows that post-pc devices are part of the future. but his poker face is fun to watch with hindsight. watch part of the interview with jobs and gates "
" (cnn) -- a 19-year-old who is probably the world's most noted iphone hacker said thursday he's been hired by apple, the very company whose products he's been hacking into. it's been really, really fun, but it's also been a while and i've been getting bored, nicholas allegra, who's better known by his pseudonym comex, posted on twitter . so, the week after next i will be starting an internship with apple. apple did not immediately respond to a cnn request for comment on comex's internship at the company. forbes writer andy greenberg revealed comex's identity this month, calling him the iphone uber-hacker who keeps outsmarting apple. in the story, he noted that comex was looking for an internship, and he suggested that apple give him one. now it has, he wrote friday . comex started the website jailbreakme, which lets iphone users jailbreak their phones simply by visiting that site. a jailbroken iphone can run apps that are not approved by apple for sale in its app store. the phones also can then be unlocked, which makes it possible to use them on wireless networks that apple hasn't approved. international travelers like that feature. other apple hackers have praised the site as being incredibly sophisticated. dino dai zovi told forbes that comex's work is as impressive as stuxnet, a computer worm that apparently targeted iran's nuclear facilities last year. it's fairly common -- more so than you might expect, at least -- for big tech companies to hire once-nefarious hackers. these coding gurus are sometimes better versed in the security vulnerabilities of a company's products than anyone else in the industry. and, these companies hope, the former hackers could use these skills to make their products safer. the blog macrumors says apple has made similar hires in the past: earlier this year mobilenotifier developer peter hajas was picked up as an apple summer intern. venturebeat, however, says that's a new phenomenon for the world's largest tech company: hiring hackers isn't new in the tech world, but it's a fairly recent development for apple, which has usually tried to squash hackers by more traditional means. greenberg, at forbes, says these hires don't always go well: george hotz, one of the first iphone hackers, was sued by sony after reverse engineering the playstation 3, a move that set off a wave of user anger at the company, resulting in more than 20 retaliatory hacking attacks by the hacker collective anonymous and others. but he argues the comex hire may be good for apple: apple, by taking the carrot instead of stick approach, has saved itself that massive pr headache. and by hiring someone who actually understands its products' security weaknesses, it may just be making its users safer, too.

" (cnn) -- for east coast residents keeping a worried eye on hurricane irene, there's a host of mobile apps, twitter feeds and other digital tools available to help. here are a few of them, including suggestions for how to stay plugged in if weather knocks out power in your area. hurricanehd ($3.99 in apple store) hurricanehd provides exclusive video, blog posts from weather experts and other tools for folks watching irene and other future storms. it has a tracking map that can display multiple storms at the same time, sends active storm bulletins and contains an archive of information about past hurricanes. it can also use gps to tell you how far away you are from various points of a nearing storm. weather channel (free for apple and android devices) both the android and apple versions feature animated radar, video, local forecasts and the ability to upload photos and videos of local weather. weather channel max , free for the ipad, adds full-screen, customizable weather maps, in-motion radar and real-time twitter feeds from weather channel meteorologists. hurricane hound ($1.99, android) based on google maps, hurricane hound tracks storms in the atlantic and east pacific, as well as passing along national weather service advisories and warnings. stormpulse stormpulse is a website that uses date from the national hurricane center, cloud imagery from the nerc satellite station and basic imagery from nasa. users can click back and forth to show radar, cloud cover, watches and warnings and other features on a real-time map. twitter feeds in the face of emergency situations, the fast-paced, minute-by-minute updates you can get from twitter are handy. whether you're a twitter user or not, you can pull up and read individual feeds as long as you have web access. the ocean service from noaa, the federal government's science agency for oceans and coasts, has a twitter feed to follow. noaa also runs @stormprediction -- a feed specifically tailored toward sharing severe weather alerts. and fema has a feed to share preparation tips and news about emergency response efforts. of course, we're also inclined to suggest you follow cnn's huge team of folks following the storm. here is a curated list of twitter accounts for the cnn team dedicated to irene. staying powered assuming mobile networks are up and running, folks in areas hit by a storm like irene could be affected anyway by persisting power outages. to stay plugged-in, it will be important to have a power source to recharge your mobile devices that doesn't depend on plugging into the wall or desktop. the gadget reviewers at cnet are fans of the solio universal and cps cellboost chargers. battery companies like energizer offer multiple chargers, and the store where you bought your phone (or tablet) very likely sells batter-powered or solar chargers from the phone-maker or a third party. the axis is a multi-purpose device sanctioned by the american red cross. in addition to a usb charger for mobile phones and other devices, the $70, hand-crank-powered device has an am/fm/noaa radio and flashlight. think of it as the techie swiss army knife for power-out disasters. a couple of things to keep in mind: solar chargers will need sunlight, so will probably be more useful in the aftermath of a storm than during the heart of it. and, obviously, battery-powered models are most handy with a backup supply of dry batteries. know any tools we've missed? feel free to share them in the comments, or send us a message on the @cnntech twitter feed.

" the main change is moving most of your controls from a settings page to being inline, right next to the posts, photos and tags they affect. plus there are several other updates here that will make it easier to understand who can see your stuff (or your friends') in any context. an example will help make sense of all this social-media-speak. say you want to post a photo from a friend's recent birthday party -- and you only want your good friends to be able to see it. before, you would need to go to facebook's edit friends page. then you'd need to set up a list of your facebook friends who you consider to be good friends. that can take a while. then you assign certain properties to that group, allowing them to see photos or status updates or wall posts made by other friends etc. instead of deciding which pieces of content these people will see, you choose the category. confusing much? after the change, facebook users decide who gets to see a photo right as they post it. right next to the post button on facebook, which users click to post something new to the site, there's a little lock icon. click on that and you can choose where to send that post. click customize to get the most control. google plus is similar, but it uses friend circles instead of lists. in comments on facebook's blog post about the privacy change, some users said they were impressed: well done, slowly getting better, one wrote. many, however, referenced google's new-ish social network. glad to see that competition is finally forcing facebook to improve, one person wrote. looks like, fb is transforming to g+... wrote another. and there were more than a few jokes in the comments, too: hahahaha... if you want this functionality, and want it to actually work, just use google+! tech pundit robert scoble chimed in , too: it effectively will keep people from moving to google+ because it takes away many of the advantages of google+ circles. there were some other facebook privacy changes, too. among them: -- users now can approve photo tags before they go onto their news feeds, where friends would see them. before, friends could identify you in a photo without your knowledge and post that on the network. -- a button called view profile as... now appears in the top right corner of facebook profiles. click it and then enter a name of a friend or co-worker to see what your profile looks like when they view it. -- users can change the visibility of a post after it's up. -- facebook now says public instead of everyone in its privacy-setting lingo. both terms mean everyone on the public internet -- not just friends or other facebook users -- can see that piece of content. what do you think of these changes? let us know in the comments.

" apple has not released any new information about the state of jobs' health. the 56-year-old went on medical leave in january, and he has suffered serious health problems in recent years, including pancreatic cancer and a reported liver transplant. jobs also took a somber tone in his resignation letter: i have always said if there ever came a day when i could no longer meet my duties and expectations as apple's ceo, i would be the first to let you know, he wrote in a letter to apple's board and the apple community at large. unfortunately, that day has come. in the immediate moments after the announcement, tech pundits seemed far more concerned with the state of jobs' health than the future of the company that relies on him as its creative core. apple is credited with kicking off the personal computing revolution. it also ushered in the smartphone craze after it released the iphone in 2007 and rocked the digital music industry with itunes. the tech blog gizmodo wrote a short tribute to jobs: we very, very much hope that the greatest businessman, ceo and product developer of our era is doing okay, and that this decision does not mean his health has taken a turn for the worse. he is an icon and idol who has made this world we live in a better place. we sincerely and deeply wish mr. jobs and his family the best. more from a commenter on the blog boy genius report : best of luck to steve!! i have nothing but love and respect for him and the way that he handled things at apple! he created the best tech company in the world! i wish him luck on whatever he does from here on out! and good luck to tim cook! he's gotta fill some size 100000000 shoes!!! even people who aren't generally apple fans praised jobs: while i may not like some of apple's practices and tactics, there is no denying that steve jobs took that company at its lowest point and made it into the gold standard of consumer technology, wrote eric geller, in a discussion cnn tech started on the google plus social network. not since bill gates has any tech executive been this iconic and well-known among mainstream consumers. others jokingly compared the news to other signs of the apocalypse, including the rare earthquake that hit the east coast earlier this week. earthquake, hurricane, middle east on the brink of war, now steve jobs resigns? the apocalypse is very, very near, folks, a twitter user wrote. and still others passed around bits of apple nostalgia. the blog boing boing shared an early apple commercial from 1984 . tim carmody, a blogger at wired, posted on google plus a 2001 video of jobs introducing the first apple store. feel free to share your thoughts about this news in the comments section below.

" istria is not the new tuscany by brendan francis newnam , special to cnn story highlights croatia's istrian peninsula inspires comparisons with italy's tuscany region while there are similarities, this pocket of croatia hasn't suffered a tourism crush its villages are less cultivated, less wealthy and delightfully unspoiled brendan francis newnam hosts a national public radio show called the dinner party download produced by american public media. he's the author of the cnn.com travel column the state i'm in. follow him on twitter @bnewnam. (cnn) -- word on the cobblestone street is istria is the new tuscany. i disagree. the landscape of this northern part of croatia is less cultivated. it's less wealthy. and, last i checked, the renaissance didn't happen here. plus, istria is still a little-known proper noun and tuscany has moved into adjective territory. show me an american suburb and i'll show you a tuscan kitchen, if not an entire foreclosed development named tuscan hills. earlier this year when olive garden -- the strip mall home of endless breadsticks -- wanted to make itself more appealing, it announced it was making over its restaurants in the style of tuscan farmhouses. now, i don't know if they serve shark in tuscany, but the region has certainly jumped it. that's not going to happen to istria anytime soon. no, it will continue to hide in plain sight. right in the middle of europe. a small peninsula the shape of a crudely drawn heart tucked behind the boot of italy. capped by the alps; bottom dangling in the cartoon blue of the adriatic sea. eventually the tour buses and cookbook authors will arrive en masse, but for now the region is so sparsely populated that sometimes with its raw grandeur and new highways it can feel like an imaginary world in a video game where you build your own civilization. turns out civilization has existed in istria since at least the bronze age, when people lived in gradines, fortified castles built on the tops of hills. houses and walls from that time are still visible as are the many structures left behind by all those who have ruled this region: the illyrians, the romans, the venetians, the austro-hungarians; you name them and they probably killed people and built churches here. the italians controlled the area until 1947 when it was ceded to then-yugoslavia after the world war ii. now it is part of croatia. for the modern invader, istria comes in two flavors: coastal paradise and rustic hilltop hamlet. because the region is only about 50 miles wide and 60 miles north to south you can have both in the same day. the coast is necklaced with tourist towns and fishing villages. from glamorous opatija, a 19th century playground for austro-hungarian nobility, to pula, a gritty port town with an ace up its sleeve: a stunning roman amphitheater built between 27 b.c. and 68 a.d. (once used for gladiator fights, the arena is still used for, depending on your point of view, less menacing entertainment from the likes of norah jones and sting.) but the most beautiful coastal town in istria, and possibly all of croatia, is rovinj. a perennial contender for the best-place-to-watch-a-sunset, rovinj is a stunner of pastel homes, polished stones and blue water. the town flag could very well be one of the bathing suits or dish towels that charmingly flap along the laundry lines strung throughout this picturesque but lived-in little peninsula off a peninsula. rovinj feels very italian (it has been described as a bit of venice spilled on a hill ) right down to the fashionably dressed women accompanied by tidy men in leather loafers and colorful sweaters hugging their necks. the town's narrow alleyways and courtyards house several great restaurants and numerous places to have a drink while the sun disappears. day and night it's the ideal venue to run the croatian triathlon: swim, eat and lounge at a cafe. but that's not my favorite part of istria. and it's not the part that people are thinking of when they label this area the new tuscany. they are referring to the heart of the heart-shaped peninsula. the verdant interior filled with surprises like mistletoe brandy, hilltop hamlets and hum, the smallest town in the world. although the air is perfumed by the nearby sea, inland istria is a world away from the coast's busy beaches and ice cream stands. take any exit off the highway and you'll find one tiny village after another, each with its own shambolic charm and unique architectural legacy. ever since the romans ripped out cypresses and replaced them with olive groves, this area has been renowned for its cuisine. pliny the elder called istrian olive oil the second best in the world (after italian olive oil, of course) and contemporary foodies geek out over the area's distinguished grape varietals and artisanal hams and cheeses. istria's forests are filled with game, but the most hunted creature in the region is the truffle -- a noble fungus immune to cultivation that fetches up to $2,000 a pound. they come in black and white (the latter is more prized) and they come on top of steak, shaved on pasta, drowned in olive oil and blended with rice. a well-prepared local lunch here rivals any meal in europe. recently i was enjoying one of those meals in the mesmerizing town of groznjan, a medieval hamlet on a hill that's home to 30 galleries and a summer jazz school that bestows an intermittent bebop soundtrack to the ancient landscape. as i sat in the shaded stone courtyard taking in the soft breeze and lazily scraping up the last bits of lunch from my plate, it occurred to me that this must have been what tuscany was like before the hollywood movies, the cookbooks and the hordes of tourists: tuscany when it was still under-the-radar and affordable. before the olive garden had ever laid eyes on it. no, istria is not the new tuscany, i thought. it's the old tuscany.

" by far, the worst flash-mob violence has occurred over the past few weeks in the united kingdom. angry hordes terrorized neighborhoods in london, birmingham and elsewhere. buildings were torched. people were beaten. homes were vandalized and looted. british authorities said the rioters communicated their intent for destruction through blackberry messenger, a private mobile-messaging system that's popular with young people in the uk. one reported text read: if you're down for making money, we're about to go hard in east london. police playing catch-up at least one expert believes most members of law enforcement are far behind the times when it comes to battling flash robs. part of the challenge is generational. older officers in management positions -- the ones making decisions -- are often not as savvy as younger officers with social media, said nancy kolb, who oversees the international association of chiefs of police's center for social media . it's important to empower your younger officers, or those with expertise, to teach everyone else. many authorities said they believed for years that flash mobs were not a threat. the impression among officers was that flash mobs were harmless groups of strangers responding to a text or e-mail inviting them to gather to perform a cute choreographed dance routine in a public place, kolb said. witness the recent at t commercial about an ill-timed flash-mob dancer in new york's grand central terminal. in october, the police executives group sent a survey to 728 law enforcement agencies in 48 states asking if flash mobs were a problem in their community. eighty-one percent of respondents said no. more than 70% of responding agencies also said they had not identified any goals for officers' use of social-media tools such as facebook and twitter, even though the vast majority of law enforcement officers were using them. sixty-six percent of respondents said they had received no training in how to use social media. when the group's center for social media opened about a year and a half ago with justice department funds, flash mobs had only begun to show a dark side. today, investigators are asking themselves: why did flash mobs seem to go suddenly from fun to frightening? jeff gardere, a california psychologist who lectures widely on the motivations of young people, said he's not surprised by the shift. we're at a point where everyone understands the power of a flash mob, he said. people inevitably started thinking this was accessible to them, and of course it is -- everyone has a phone. gardere said he believes that part of the reason flash mobs have gotten violent is that young people are discontent and bored. they don't have jobs. they hear their parents talking about the lack of jobs. they feel their options are winnowing every day. this isn't just in england or philly or germantown but everywhere, gardere said. you've got a group that feels angry and powerless, and they're trying to assume a sense of power. a curfew in philadelphia until recently, most law enforcement officials assumed flash mobs only happened in large cities. it was philadelphia who had the problem -- that seemed to be the thinking, kolb said. since the spring of 2010, police have reported a series of violent flash-mob incidents in central philadelphia. in one episode last year, a crowd of some 200 lawbreakers, mostly teenagers, roamed the streets robbing bystanders and breaking windows. authorities suspect the group gathered after seeing a call on facebook or twitter to meet up. last month another flash mob of about 30 teens allegedly beat two apparent bystanders near philadelphia city hall, knocking one unconscious and breaking another person's jaw. that incident came just weeks after a gang of youths, who philadelphia authorities say were stoked by a call on social media, attacked diners leaving restaurants and robbed train passengers. other flash robbers swarmed stores, grabbed what they liked and walked out. the violence prompted mayor michael nutter and police to enforce a citywide curfew mandating that anyone under 18 be indoors by midnight. parents of violators would be fined $500, they warned. law enforcement experts believe that has been the most significant step to date in calming flash mobs . philadelphia police investigators also have been friending younger philadelphians on facebook in the hopes of monitoring chatter about potential mayhem. the curfew idea was a great one, but temporary. the facebook idea is where we need to go, said los angeles county sheriff's capt. mike parker, a leading expert on how law enforcement should use social media to fight crime. name the social-networking site, and parker has used it to help track down a criminal or do a background check. the skill he most often teaches other officers is how to recognize a facebook posting or a twitter hashtag that suggests flash-mob planning is under way. 'flash calling' and the game parker is helping lead the los angeles county sheriff's department investigation of hip-hop artist the game, who sent a twitter message last week that contained the phone number to a sheriff's station. hundreds of the rapper's 580,000 twitter followers overwhelmed dispatchers with calls, effectively preventing the public access to emergency help. the game apologized for his tweet on cnn on wednesday. it's unclear if he will be charged. that raises another question for law enforcement -- how should a person who encourages mayhem in a tweet be treated by the justice system? ucla law professor eugene volokh said he believes they should be prosecuted the same way as someone who incites violence in person. we don't need to create a new set of laws for an old set of problems, volokh told cnn. but parker said police don't have a solution yet on how to stop flash calling. just when we thought flash mobs were a problem, we have this to deal with, the sheriff's captain said. but that's technology. there's always going to be something (new). authorities fight back online many law enforcement agencies across the country are financially strapped and understaffed. in los angeles county, the sheriff's department has lost 500 officers recently to budget cuts, parker said. parker recommends that local agencies pool staff and budgets to train officers on social-media tools. he also suggests they set up websites for posting video -- such as surveillance-camera footage of a suspect -- that authorities want the public to see, promoted through the department's twitter and facebook accounts. this is so basic, but if you know there's going to be a dance, you have to get on the invite list, parker says. you have to be on these sites -- facebook, twitter, foursquare, flickr -- with the mindset that you're not just watching passively. you're engaging. parker urges fellow officers to network with citizens on facebook and twitter as a way of monitoring chatter and increasing cooperation with police. make yourself a friend, approachable. you have to position yourself in a way that isn't threatening, because we really are not there to shut down anyone's fun, he said. parker said the online chatter about flash mobs is often full of boasting. would-be flash mobbers usually assume the police are the enemy, he said, so they amp themselves up for a fight. if you see that, try to get involved in the discussion and dispel it, he said. it's all basic communication. let me try to understand you, and you try to understand where i'm coming from. police in maryland acted quickly and creatively after the 7-eleven robbery. within hours, investigators posted surveillance camera footage on youtube and blasted out that link on local media. detectives then headed to a local high school, where they asked the principal and students to help them identify faces. within a day, they had identified at least half of the alleged thieves, said smith, the police spokeswoman. no arrests had been made as of thursday morning. but we feel confident, smith said. technology and old-fashioned police work are on our side.

" judge: indiana teens' racy social media photos are protected speech by ali elkin, cnn story highlights teenagers posed with phallic-shaped rainbow lollipops and posted the photos online parent brought print-outs of the photos to the superintendent school suspended girls from sports, sent them to counseling, asked them to apologize indiana district judge found the school had violated the students' first amendment rights (cnn) -- an indiana school district might appeal a summary judgment that said it violated two students' first amendment rights by punishing them for posting racy photos to social networking sites, the district's lawyer said. the female students, then both rising sophomores, took a series of photos featuring phallic-shaped rainbow lollipops at several sleepovers during summer 2009. none of the photos were openly accessible to non-friends or those who did not have a photo-sharing password. the pictures got into school officials' hands after a parent printed them and complained to the district's superintendent that they had caused divisiveness on the plaintiffs' volleyball team. the opinion , which district judge philip simon issued on august 10, said the smith-green school district in churubusco, indiana, did not have the right to temporarily bar the two students from extracurricular activities, require them to go to counseling and apologize to the district's all-male coaches board. the opinion does not identify the students, as they are both minors. regardless they are the butt of several jokes throughout simon's 38-page explanation of his decision. let's be honest about it: the speech in this case doesn't exactly call to mind high-minded civic discourse about current events, simon writes. churubusco high school's code of conduct says activities in or out of school that could dishonor the school are punishable, but the opinion questions the policy's constitutionality. erik weber, general counsel for smith-green schools, said the district does not see the code as being unconstitutional. there's a judgment that's been rendered by the court. it's respected because it's rendered by a judge, but it doesn't mean that the school is going to agree with that and settle the litigation at this point, weber said. it's an unsettled area of the law, and i don't think this is going to be the final say on how social media and the school environment intertwine. a decision on a portion of the school's defense is still pending, weber said. another indiana district recently won a case that granted it immunity from paying damages under the 11th amendment, which grants such immunity to states. that district is defending the decision in an appellate court. weber said the smith-green district will wait on that case's outcome, and consequently the decision for its own case, before deciding whether or not to appeal. the american civil liberties union is representing the students. ken falk, legal director of the aclu's indiana chapter, said just because schools have access to information about students' behavior outside school does not mean they have the authority to discipline that behavior. what schools have to recognize is there is that line and the type of stuff that my friends and i in high school did -- i'm in my late 50s now -- the school never knew about, falk said. now, of course, with social media, the school and school personnel can easily find out. but that doesn't change the calculus. simon's opinion disagreed with the district's arguments that the photos should not be considered protected speech. the ruling says they do not count as obscene or child pornography because they contain no nudity and had a high probability of being understood as humorous by their intended teenage audience. additionally, the court opinion holds the situation up against landmark supreme court speech-in-school cases, applying them with the added variable of social media. one of the major issues in the case was whether the girls' pictures qualify as a substantial disruption to school operations, which would then not be protected speech. simon's opinion said the photo shoots, conducted off school property without portraying any school insignia and not shared with the wider school community, were not such a disruption. a student cannot be punished with a ban from extracurricular activities for nondisruptive speech, the opinion says. as schools and courts grapple with determining where a school's authority ends online, more first amendment cases like this one will crop up, said catherine ross, a professor at the george washington university law school and author of the forthcoming the troubled first amendment in our public schools. traditionally, one could talk about a kind of geographical analogy with speech in schools, ross said. it was fairly clear what speech took place in school and what speech took place out of school. new tests are starting to emerge to determine whether online speech takes place in school, such as determining whether the person who created the speech made it available at school. without such distinctions, the school would become almost a police state that could reach out and discipline students for what they do anywhere, ross said. if we are going to delegate decision-making authority to school officials, as we have to, since i don't think we want the courts running the schools, then we have to hold them to a high standard, she said. ross said there are some very clear-cut examples of online behavior that constitute disturbances in school. cyberbullying, for example, interferes with a student's education. though ross said she agreed with simon's opinion, she said the digs and jokes that pervade the document should not belittle the importance of the students' decision to pursue the case. these two girls and their families stood up for first amendment rights, ross said. and while the judge makes a few comments at their expense, the only way we preserve rights is when people are willing to fight for them. so whatever misjudgment these girls showed in their so-called bad behavior, for society this is very productive litigation, because it protects the rights of other students, as well.

" yosemite national park, california (cnn) -- a 17th person has died in yosemite national park, which has been experiencing a higher than usual number of fatalities this year, authorities said. authorities have identified a man who fell monday evening off half dome, the park's renowned soaring granite formation in the sierra nevada, park officials said wednesday. the person, whose body was recovered tuesday at the base of half dome by rangers, was identified as ryan leeder, 23, of los gatos, california, park officials said. the incident appears to be accidental and remains under investigation, park spokesmen said wednesday. the 17 deaths are about twice the usual rate at yosemite, officials said. authorities are searching for answers to explain the recent rash of deaths at the national park in california. in july, near yosemite's beautiful mist trail, a young man lost his footing, slipping close to the edge of a waterfall. a female companion frantically grabbed for him but stumbled. another hiker followed and the three were swept over the powerful 317-foot vernal fall. authorities at yosemite national park are still searching for two of the bodies. that month was the busiest july for the park since 1985, with 730,487 visitors, park officials said. last year, the park recorded 4,047,880 visitors, according to a statistical chart provided by park spokesmen. while five visitors have died this year from natural causes, the others were accidental and often preventable, officials said. rangers say some visitors partake in dangerous practices such as hiking treacherous trails in flip-flops, climbing over safety rails to take better pictures or swimming perilously close to waterfalls. witnesses told park authorities that the three hikers who were swept over the waterfall in july had climbed over a safety rail. we don't station a ranger in every possible dangerous place that's out there, said kari cobb, a park ranger. people have to come here and realize that yosemite is nature, and it is a very wild place. bill ott, a hiker, said he has seen people swimming in dangerous waters. we saw a number of people wading just steps from going into the faster water. it's crazy. just crazy, he said. visitor tim timmerman said he has a plan to keep his family safe. we aren't worried because we think if you stay where you're supposed to stay, you're safe and it's exciting, timmerman said. it'll be a little scary for them, but it's not dangerous if you do what you're supposed to do. cnn's casey wian reported from yosemite national park.

" read more about this story from cnn affiliate kyw . (cnn) -- the owner of a south philadelphia cheesesteak shop who once instructed customers to order only in english has died, according to relatives. joey vento had a heart attack at home and died tuesday on the way to the hospital, said joseph perno, his nephew and manager of the shop. things are a little somber tonight, perno told cnn affiliate kyw behind the grill at geno's. but he's in our hearts. vento founded geno's in 1966 in philadelphia, where it sits across the street from another cheesesteak shop, pat's king of steaks. pat's claims to have invented the cheesesteak in 1933, but both stores welcome a plethora of visitors to the city of brotherly love each year, and serve the popular steak sandwiches 24 hours a day, seven days a week. for more than 40 years, the rivals have been engaged in a friendly competition over who makes the city's best cheesesteak. geno's became a popular stop for presidential candidates on the campaign trail and a photo gallery on the restaurant's website shows employees posing with celebrities such as oprah, shaquille o'neal and ray romano. vento made national headlines in 2006 when he posted a sign on one of his restaurant's windows that read, this is america. when ordering, please speak english. the sign prompted the philadelphia commission on human relations to file a discrimination suit. vento said he was using common sense by expecting americans to speak english at his establishment, and refused to take down the sign. two years after the controversy began, the suit was overturned. since his death, fans are using twitter and facebook to leave messages. joey vento was a true american patriot, one message read. others paid tribute to his famed sandwiches. thank you for making the world just a little bit better by being here. now heaven will have the best cheesesteaks in the world!! rip joey "
" arizona sues over key provision of civil rights act by bill mears , cnn supreme court producer story highlights the law requires that local voting changes be cleared by the justice department the state alleges random enforcement based on the whim of federal authorities u.s. attorney general eric holder vows to defend the law in court a 2009 supreme court ruling opened the door to challenges to the preclearance provision (cnn) -- arizona has become the latest jurisdiction to challenge continuing federal oversight over a key provision of the landmark civil rights act of 1965. officials in phoenix filed a lawsuit in federal court thursday, saying requirements to preclear all local voting changes with the u.s. justice department are unconstitutional. it follows a supreme court ruling two years ago that gave states and local communities more power to appeal the preclearance provision of the law. that section provides continuing federal control over election practices in 16 states, based on past discrimination against minority voters. other states are not covered by the provision even if they, too, might discriminate against minority voters. the conservative high court majority ruled the justice department was applying the powerful enforcement tool too broadly. arizona attorney general tom horne said washington punishes states with random enforcement based on the whim of federal authorities. arizona has been subjected to enforcement actions for problems that were either corrected nearly 40 years ago and have not been repeated, or penalized for alleged violations that have no basis in the constitution, horne said. that needs to stop. at issue is whether congress in 2006 properly extended the civil rights law -- whose section 5 mandates that the covered states get advance approval of changes in how their elections are conducted -- or whether the country has made enough progress on racial equality to make continued federal oversight essentially unnecessary. the high court concluded in its narrow ruling that sufficient progress had been made. under the law, things have changed in the south. voter turnout and registration rates now approach parity, wrote chief justice john roberts. past success alone, however, is not adequate justification to retain the preclearance requirements. the act imposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs. but while opening the door for challenges to the law, the court upheld the federal government's enforcement power. and it refused to resolve the larger constitutional questions of when race-based solutions can be used to remedy past and present voter discrimination. with this legal challenge from arizona, the conservative majority may be poised to tackle the issue in coming years. but first, a federal judge will handle the state's lawsuit. no trial has yet been scheduled. attorney general eric holder vowed to defend the law in court. the voting rights act plays a vital role in our society by ensuring that every american has the right to vote and to have that vote counted, holder said in a prepared statement. the department of justice will vigorously defend the constitutionality of the voting rights act in this case, as it has done successfully in the past. the provisions challenged in this case, including the preclearance requirement, were reauthorized by congress in 2006 with overwhelming and bipartisan support. the 2009 high court case involved a small homeowners association board outside austin, texas. residents of the canyon creek planned community eight years ago sought to move its federal-election polling place to an elementary school that is the neighborhood's polling place for all other elections. such a move required federal approval under section 5, which was eventually granted. backed by a group of conservative activists, residents launched a direct challenge to the law's preclearance provision, arguing it should not be enforced in areas where it can be argued racial discrimination no longer exists. the high court's ruling made the texas district eligible to bail out, or become exempt from future federal oversight. civil rights groups say section 5 has proven an important tool to protect minority voters from local governments that could set unfair or unconstitutional barriers to the polls. if it were to be ruled unconstitutional someday, they argue, the very power and effect of the entire voting rights act would crumble. since 1982, only 17 jurisdictions have been able to bail out or become exempt from federal oversight, out of about 12,000 covered political jurisdictions. arizona has also challenged washington's authority to enforce immigration laws. a state measure known as sb 1070 would, among other things, give local law enforcement agencies the power to apprehend and help deport illegal immigrants. the obama administration say immigration is the exclusive role of the federal government. the civil rights case is state of arizona v. holder.

" steve largent of the industry's wireless association said that it was comparable to a flood of cars causing a traffic jam at rush hour. a huge number of users were trying to use the same highway at the same time, which caused the jam, he said. he argued that one solution would be to apportion more bandwidth to the wireless industry. with more spectrum, we'd have more lanes that would allow more users, he said. but university of maryland engineering professor ashok agrawala said that solving the problem was not that simple. whichever system you design has a finite capacity, he said. moreover, he said, if they built a capacity which can handle the peak load that we had at the time of the earthquake, most of the time, most of that system will remain idle. and that will be expensive, he said, making everyone's phone bills go up. still, why don't 911 calls get priority over all other cell phone calls? there should be some way to prioritize it for emergency calls, said fcc's barnett. technology is on the way, called lte, that would allow it to go to the top of the cue. he said the fcc is asking the major cell carriers to consult with them on implementing it. with hurricane irene bearing down on the east coast, just days after that earthquake, residents might wonder whether the same problem will strike again. since a storm does not strike at a single instant, a sudden overload of calls is less likely. but if cell phone towers are affected, wireless callers could again face trouble getting through. officials and phone companies suggest that customers who can't get a connection should try texting instead. on tuesday, @fema tweeted this: reminder: if cell phone service is busy, text or e-mail friends/family to let them know you're ok. how can text messages get through, even when phone calls can't? a live, two-minute phone call takes a full two minutes to transmit -- it can't be shortened, and it can't be time-shifted. but a 100-character text can be transmitted in a fraction of a second, and can be put in a cue to be transmitted whenever a free route is identified. sprint spokeswoman crystal davis said, we could get roughly 30-50 text messages (if not more) sent in the same period of time a call would take place.

" on north carolina's ocracoke, there is only one way off the island -- by ferry. the county ordered tourists and residents to evacuate. bobby hill, the emergency manager for the north carolina ferry division, said more than 1,500 people left wednesday. the ferries are operating all day thursday, he said, but the last chance for anyone to get off the isolated, skinny island sticking out in the atlantic, is one boat friday morning. after that, well, you are out of options. clayton gaskill was one of about 100 ocracoke residents still around thursday night. in between playing progressive rock songs on community radio wovv-fm, he talked about residents making final preparations. you pick up stuff that will float. this is a little more serious than many of them, gaskill said, referring to other storms in the region. isabel in 2003 and alex in 2004 did have significant impact. residents have a couple grocery stores, ice and an emergency electrical source to help them ride out and recover from irene. as long as the storm is in progress, you are on your own, gaskill said. hill has lived through 15 hurricanes in his lifetime: floyd, hazel, connie, david. he's used to boarding up his home in coastal beaufort and firing up the generator. you might call him a veteran. you're a veteran of one and they still keep coming, he said. irene? well, it will be another name on the long list. janeen wall has only one name in her hurricane memory. floyd in 1999. it was scary, she said. so much so that wall was not taking any chances. she arrived at her rented vacation condo on carolina beach just this monday. but by thursday, she was safely back home in richmond, virginia, buying extra bottles of water and gas for the grill, in case the power goes out. in wilmington, north carolina, leigh muscle planned a dream wedding for saturday -- along the intracoastal waterway, of course. literally my first reaction was, 'nooo!,' muscle told cnn affiliate wway. she had planned to walk down the aisle in the front yard of her mother's house; the reception was to be in the back yard, along the water. as of now, it looks like it's just going to be a little bit of rain and a little bit of wind, and it just looks like we need to move the event from outside to inside, so that's what we're planning, muscle said. she's hoping a perfect storm won't ruin her perfect day. on nags head, leanne and nathan robinson, surfers since they were kids, hoped to ride a few waves like they do in every hurricane the north carolina natives have lived through. the winds are too high during the hit, but the swell before and after the storm could be ideal. but this time, it's different. not because irene is so huge, or that she is eyeing the outer banks. but this time, the young couple owns a house. this time, they have a 2-year-old daughter to protect. if it looks like a direct hit, leanne plans to evacuate with their child. nathan will stay to look after the house and the surf shop that leanne manages. we are going to wait until tomorrow afternoon to make a decision, leanne robinson said. in the meantime, they've brought in the tomato plants, picked up debris and tied down everything that needs to be secured. and they cut dead branches off the tall pines in their yard. farther north in lewes, delaware, georgia tugend is planning to ride out the storm along with her husband, dave, and dog, barkley. our plan is not to leave, tugend said. temporary shelters will not take the dog, and we feel that our house is elevated enough that we would avoid any possible storm surge. tugend, who lives about half a mile from the delaware bay, said she and her husband are securing several items in their yard, including outdoor furniture and a 14-foot aluminum boat. we're going to hope for the best as far as the cars go, she said, noting that they don't have a garage. tugend said she plans to fill her tub with water, and may stock up on extra beer as well. we had some really bad storms this past fall and winter with gusts clocked up to 70 miles per hour. we know we can get through that, she said. but you don't want to get cocky. if we get 100-mile per hour winds, that's a different ballgame. we've never lived through that. in nearby dewey beach, 71-year-old allan lynch was taking steps to protect his restaurant, the captain's table. lynch, a lifelong resident of the area, is planning to cover all of the windows at the restaurant, take down loose signs outside and bring in his trash cans. lynch said he will probably close his business. he's also bringing in a supply of dry ice to help preserve the restaurant's food in case power is lost. as for himself, lynch said he would probably go inland a little bit and seek shelter with his 90-year-old mother if the storm becomes severe enough. lynch's wife stocked up extra milk, water and batteries. some described their preparations as minimal, such as nathan nickerson in cape cod, massachusetts. but i've got my chainsaw sharpened, and i've got my tractor ready to clear the way if there are a lot of downed trees, he said. nickerson predicted that traffic at his business -- arnold's lobster and clam bar in eastham -- will probably drop off to nothing, at least temporarily. but the place will stay open as long as it can, nickerson said. thursday, he was already taking down several awnings, tents, and umbrellas. if nothing else, he joked, he would hold arnold's annual employee party during the storm. meanwhile, the owner of alex's bait tackle at point pleasant beach in new jersey said he's preparing for the worst. he's going to put as many as 150 sandbags in front of his water's edge store. i will stay here as long as i can, marc palazzo said. most storms i ride out, but for the first time in 15 years i'm thinking of not riding this one out. i think the storm will head right up the jersey shore at this point, he said. and locally, i don't think we're prepared. nobody's boarding up anything, and there could be some major devastation. stores even farther north in new hampshire were also gearing up for irene. the emergency display was up at the home depot in manchester, reported cnn affiliate wmur. generators. flashlights. backpack survival kits. and extra supplies of sump pumps. peter hoiries, who works for a restoration company, warned residents of irene's strong winds. standard shingles used in the new england area are good only for 75 miles per hour, he said. older ones could blow off in even lighter winds. in horseneck beach, massachusetts, the sun beat down thursday. no sign of irene yet, but people asked: what if? boat owners in falmouth harbor began removing their vessels, according to cnn affiliate whdh. some people find it exciting, the prospect of a hurricane -- generally thought of as a southern thing -- heading to new england. but veterans were quick to say beware. they're exciting until they get a week into not having hot water, refrigerator, running around for ice and no electric power, said bruce crenshaw, a charter boat captain. the excitement wears off quick. the reality is that many folks on the east coast were still in a wait-and-see mode thursday, as irene -- slowly but surely -- made her way toward them. cnn's phil gast contributed to this report.

" (cnn) -- elmhurst college, a private liberal arts school in suburban chicago affiliated with the united church of christ, has become the first college in the country to ask an optional question about a student's sexual orientation and gender identity on an undergraduate admission form, according to the school and a gay rights advocacy group. would you consider yourself a member of the lgbt (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) community? the new application asks prospective enrollees. students can answer yes, no, or prefer not to say. that optional demographic question is among others about religious affiliation, language spoken at home and whether they have worked with a community-based organization, according to the college and the advocacy group. the sexual orientation question is designed to help the college advance diversity and connect prospective students with school resources such as scholarships and campus organizations. we took this step in an effort to better serve each of our students as a unique person, elmhurst president s. alan ray said in a news release thursday. it also allows us to live out our commitments to cultural diversity, social justice, mutual respect among all persons, and the dignity of every individual. these are among the core values of this institution. they provide the foundation for all of our academic, student and community programs, ray said. added gary rold, dean of admission, in the media release: all of the information that we glean from our admission applications is used to provide a wide variety of opportunities, services and programming that is appropriate to each individual student. shane windmeyer, executive director of campus pride, which calls itself the leading national nonprofit advocating safer learning environments for lgbt college students, praised elmhurst college. elmhurst college has really set the bar when it comes to college admissions and allowing lgbt students to be who they are and to be out, windmeyer said. as a result, they can take responsibility for setting a safe learning environment for all students. for the past five years, campus pride has been trying to get the optional question included in a standardized online college application now used by more than 400 u.s. universities, including ivy league schools, windmeyer said. but that effort by campus pride has been unsuccessful, windmeyer said. elmhurst college is among the remaining 2,100 public and private four-year institutions in the country that are not part of that nonprofit membership organization using the standardized online application, windmeyer said. located in elmhurst, illinois, the college is affiliated with the united church of christ, a protestant denomination that was the first to ordain a woman in the 19th century. it was also the first to ordain an openly gay person in the 20th century: william r. johnson, a graduate of elmhurst college, who became a church minister in 1972, according to the school. the school describes itself as being at times pioneering on social justice issues, according to its news release. of course, we recognize that this question may signal to applicants that elmhurst is 'walking the walk' of support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons, ray said in the release. this is a source of pride for us. it is entirely consistent with our mission and vision to prepare students to understand and respect the diversity of the world's cultures and peoples.

" a hand opened the small slit in the door where his food was passed through. he heard someone angrily shouting and pointing at verses in an open quran pushed through the door. not long after, someone hammered off the lock on the door. at first he thought it was a trap, he told his mother by phone, maybe a ruse to get him in greater danger. but then the realization dawned: he had a chance to escape. i saw some other prisoners and they were cheering and pointing down the hall, said an exhausted vandyke. i knew i was free, but didn't know what to do or what was going on. vandyke had no possessions to gather up, only a wet and ragged prison uniform. he found a pair of sandals left behind by another fleeing prisoner and then escaped the prison along with hundreds of other inmates. many of those held in the facility were political prisoners, or had been caught up in crackdowns on rebel sympathizers or on the many battlefields edging closer to the capital. vandyke joined up with one small group walking through the abu salim neighborhood of tripoli, not knowing that they were in one of the last areas still controlled by gadhafi loyalists. they could hear explosions and gunfire, but also got news that rebels were taking control of the city. the group made their way to a mosque. there, the imam and other neighborhood leaders were handing out cash, trying to help people desperately short of supplies amid the chaos and electrical blackout in the area. vandyke said he moved on, to a makeshift hospital where he got some help and directions to a local wealthy person who had access to a working phone. it was there he was able to make his first phone call back to his worried girlfriend, lauren fischer, and mother, sharon vandyke, back in baltimore. i've always known he was ok, sharon vandyke told cnn late wednesday. the retired schoolteacher described the relief and surprise she felt after watching cnn endlessly for days, hoping for news and praying for her son's safety. now she and fischer are focused on getting him out of libya. vandyke said he was eventually able to hook up with another escaped inmate who had ties to rebel forces and could speak english. the man gained access to a car and two guards armed with ak-47 assault rifles, and they sped through the night past rebel checkpoints. eventually he arrived at a house once occupied by an american expatriate couple who had hastily fled in the earliest days of the conflict. vandyke said the home still had food on the counters, remnants from the last-second escape of the last people there, a welcome windfall for him after months of rancid prison food. and the working phone there was a lifeline to the outside, he added. the writer is one of at least four american civilians who have been freed from libyan prisons, the u.s. government said wednesday. we can confirm that all u.s. citizens who were known to be detained in libya have been released, u.s. state department spokesperson victoria nuland said in a prepared statement: the families of those detained individuals have been notified of their freedom and welfare. we remain concerned about the welfare and safety of those u.s. citizens who remain in tripoli. for safety and privacy reasons we are unable to provide additional details. vandyke was surprised to hear that other americans had been held in the prison and was unaware of their escape or current situations. having traveled to nearly a dozen middle eastern and african countries since 2007, vandyke left for benghazi in late february. friends there had told him what was happening in libya during the early stages of the revolution. he had a great respect for the people and the country, not the politics, his mother said. vandyke's loved ones aren't certain why he was arrested, although he had a u.s. passport and press credentials when he was seized on a day trip to brega. by phone, the exhausted writer said he would have a fuller account to tell of his capture after he was able to sleep and recuperate, but he said his arrest had been a surprise and he did not know the reason for it. vandyke had been confined in two prisons, including abu salim, from which he and the hundreds of others escaped wednesday, one day after rebels seized gadhafi's compound in the city. libyan officials had recently acknowledged vandyke was in custody. his mother traveled to turkey in may to seek assistance in his release, but the country had just closed its embassy in tripoli. his family, which has been assisted by the state department and u.s. rep. c.a. dutch ruppersberger of maryland, hopes to see vandyke in several days. he said he was in good physical health, said his mother. he was sorry we did not know for sure he was ok. sharon vandyke said her son was unaware that al qaeda leader osama bin laden had been killed by u.s. commandos in may. she and fischer, 28, expect vandyke, who first went to libya in 2008, to complete a book about the people he has met and places he has seen in mauritania, iraq, turkey, afghanistan, egypt and other countries. he toured several of those nations by motorcycle. despite everything, i have no problems with libyans, vandyke said, describing his safety and plans in tripoli. but i'll be determined to stay here to see the end of gadhafi.

" lifeguard sues new york over revealing swimsuit rule by katie silver , cnn story highlights roy lester says speedos are not appropriate for a 61-year-old he says a rule requiring suits like that amounts to age discrimination new york state says it does not discriminate based on age new york (cnn) -- a lifeguard is suing new york state parks for age-discrimination after a rule was put in placed that would have forced him to don swimwear he considered not appropriate for a 61-year-old. roy lester, 61, was a lifeguard at jones beach, long island for almost forty years until 2007 when the state instituted a new clothing requirement he considered discriminatory. the rule, still in operation, requires that to be re-hired as a lifeguard, participants must wear either boxers, briefs or board shorts when completing a qualifying swim test, according to new york state park documents. lester who believes that as you age you should show less skin prefers jammers; tight lycra shorts that end a couple of inches above the knee. the bankruptcy attorney claims speedos are not appropriate for a 61-year-old and refused to wear loose-fitting shorts because they would slow him down. when the jones beach lifeguard coordinators refused to let lester compete in his jammers, he saw it as the state trying to get rid of the older lifeguards. deeming this a blatant act of discrimination, he sued new york state parks in may 2007. the case was dismissed and, after appeal, it was dismissed again the following year in nassau county supreme court. the court found that since 80 of the 271 lifeguards hired in 2007 ranged from 40 to 80 years old -- six with the same age as lester -- there was no probable cause of age-based discrimination, according to court documents. however, the court reversed this decision last tuesday on second appeal allowing the case to go to trial. lester said the rule applies only to long island -- a municipality he claims has a unique disproportionate number of older lifeguards working there. it does not exist in any other municipality in the nation nor anywhere else in the world, he said. new york state parks refused to comment on the case because it is in litigation we do not discriminate based on age, is all spokesman peter brancato would say. both the attorney general for new york and the jones beach lifeguard coordinators office refused to comment. - "
" the code of conduct that had been used to bring the allegations against fairchild has been repealed. it became a campaign issue, and the new council said it wasn't needed, that existing laws and common sense were enough. morris workman lost his job at the mesquite local news; he had been under contract since selling the paper in 2009 and the contract was not renewed. a new editor took over and the site seems less newsy, with more items about community car washes and the like. after a flurry of where's morris? questions, reader comments have all but stopped. shively, who describes workman as a cancer on this town, said the reporter has the fairchilds' blood on his hands. workman shrugs off the criticism. he knows his website was not popular at city hall, which blames the political turmoil on people posting anonymous comments on the site. we get blamed for being mean, workman said. what we're guilty of is trying to get to the truth. but workman's psyche is not untouched by the turn of events. he is still blogging and working on other projects and said he's now more aware of the impact his stories have on people. it colors the way i look at things, he said. will something i do lead to a call the next morning that they have taken themselves out? the fairchild story drew comments on the website even after their deaths. posted one reader: it all seems so petty now. the tragedy came at a time when people around the country were noting the decline of civility in public discourse. the issue was on many minds in the aftermath of the january 8 assassination attempt on arizona rep. gabrielle giffords. donna fairchild's reasons for killing her husband and herself will forever remain a mystery. did she carry baggage that left her deeply disappointed in herself and ashamed of letting others down? was there something unique about mesquite's insular politics and the pressures she faced there? or could it have happened anywhere? christi kindel believes fairchild felt backed into a corner by a mean-spirited, small-town spat that unearthed other, deeply buried traumas and insecurities. suicide is the only way it ever was going to stop, she said. that's what i believe was in donna's mind. i cry for her every day. the people of mesquite have raised their voices in favor of open, civil public discourse. the mesquite that witnessed the fairchild tragedy was not the city of their dreams, they said at council meetings, candidate forums and in the mesquite local news. resident yoli bell suggested in a signed letter to the editor that the fairchilds might still be alive if the controversy had been handled with more compassion. was it necessary to plaster donna's picture with headlines to shame her like a criminal, and then accuse her like she was the first and only person who had ever done this? bell asked. i never saw anything like this done to another person until now. i just feel the dirty politics and cruel people were the last straw that broke her.

" u.s. park police spokesman david schlosser said to his eye, the monument was clearly not leaning. it's standing tall and proud. the lincoln and jefferson memorials reopened tuesday evening. witnesses reported a number of buildings were evacuated as far away as north carolina and new york, where a 5.8 earthquake struck in 1944. the quake, which was recorded at 1:51 p.m., was shallow -- just 3.7 miles deep -- and located 88 miles southwest of washington near the town of mineral, virginia. the magnitude was initially reported as 5.8, then revised to 5.9, and then revised again back to 5.8. with so many on the east coast unaccustomed to earthquakes, many people were left wondering whether all that rumbling could have been caused by a truck, helicopter, an explosion or some other force. kate duddy was in an office building elevator in manhattan, alone, when the shaking started. i have never felt a quake before. it was scary having no idea what the cause was, she said. i felt the vibrations and the elevator stopped for a period of about five minutes. the earthquake triggered the automatic shutdown of a nuclear power plant less than 20 miles from the epicenter after it lost electricity. the quake signaled unusual events at 12 other nuclear facilities across the east coast and michigan, u.s. authorities reported. dominion virginia power said both reactors at its north anna plant shut down after the first tremors. reidelbach said the plant vented steam, but there was no release of radioactive material. dan stoddard, senior vice president of nuclear operations for dominion, said there was no damage to the spent fuel pool. officials were restoring full power to the site, which was operating on diesel generators. stoddard said that might happen by late tuesday, but that was before the evening aftershock. the nuclear regulatory commission was monitoring the plant. relatively minor damage was reported in a few virginia counties, including louisa, nearest to the epicenter. several school buildings had damage, as did town hall buildings, louisa county spokeswoman amanda reidelbach told cnn. an unspecified number of minor injuries were reported in the county. desi fleming, a resident of mineral in louisa county, said the quake arrived with a rumbling that sounded like a train coming to a stop. it knocked down two chimneys on the converted 1900-vintage home that now houses her parcel-shipping business. tuesday's incident occurred in a known seismic zone in central virginia, said dave russ of the u.s. geological survey. but the strength of the earthquake was a bit surprising. a 5.9 event occurred in 1897 near blacksburg, he said. at washington's national cathedral, spokesman richard weinberg said three 5- to 8-foot pinnacles had broken from the central tower. he said stone masons and engineers would assess the damage, which also included other pieces that broke and fell on the surrounding lawn. the building was evacuated and closed to the public. wayne clough, the secretary of the smithsonian institution, said the national museum's landmark castle on the mall had cracks in interior walls. there was no immediate indication of structural damage, but the 150-year-old building will need closer examination, he said. you want to do an inspection to be sure about that, clough said. clough, who's also an earthquake engineer, said the geography of the eastern seaboard helped transmit the shock from the carolinas to new england. the underlying bedrock is largely a solid sheet, so you get a lot more travel out of earthquake waves than you would in california, he said. those waves extended to downtown new york, where court buildings were evacuated. i was trying to figure out what was going on, like everyone else, said manhattan district attorney cyrus vance, who said he had been through many earthquakes when he lived in california. mayor michael bloomberg said at an afternoon news conference that the earthquake was felt across the five boroughs of the city, but there were no reports of injuries and virtually no reports of damage. the quake was also reported to have been felt on the island of martha's vineyard, where president barack obama was playing golf. he did not feel the earthquake, according to the white house. the earthquake slowed but didn't halt major transportation services. service at major airports throughout the region was disrupted, but all were reported to have resumed normal operations about 75 minutes after the earthquake struck. at john f. kennedy international airport and newark-liberty international airport, control towers were evacuated, the port authority of new york and new jersey said. amtrak on tuesday evening said service between washington and baltimore had returned to normal speeds following inspections. in spotsylvania, virginia, tish walker said she was spooked and staying outside for the moment. i used to live in california, so i know shaking and this felt big, she said. i grabbed my dog and raced outside; my first thought is always that the furnace might explode or a cabinet crashes down on top of us. cnn's vito maggiolo, chris lawrence,

" los angeles (cnn) -- rodney king, whose videotaped beating by police led to the 1992 los angeles riots, was charged wednesday with two misdemeanor counts of driving under the influence, authorities said. his alcohol content exceeded the legal limit and he was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs, riverside county sheriff spokeswoman courtney donowho said. on july 12, king was behind the wheel of a 1994 mitsubishi when he was pulled over in moreno valley, california, about 60 miles southeast of los angeles. prosecutors have up to 45 days to file charges on a dui arrest. according to the police report, a moreno valley traffic enforcement unit observed king commit several traffic violations, donowho said, although he was not cited for speeding. after questioning king, a patrol officer noticed king exhibiting signs of behavior that might involve alcohol or drug consumption, she said. king was asked to step out of the car and submit to a voluntary field sobriety test, said donowho, adding that king was cooperative and compliant. king was arrested and transported to the moreno valley police department for an evidentiary test to determine the type of substance. following his release from custody, king told cnn he was under the influence of a medical marijuana prescription but denied being under the influence of alcohol. i had marijuana in me that i take to deal with migraine headaches and pain in my lower extremities, although i should not have been driving, he said. king was unavailable for comment on the misdemeanor charges, according to his fiancee cynthia kelly. arraignment is scheduled for friday at riverside county superior court. king's 1991 beating by los angeles police officers after a traffic stop left him with skull fractures and brain and kidney damage. it was captured on video by a nearby resident, and four officers were indicted as a result. the following year, three officers were acquitted and a mistrial was declared in a fourth officer. those verdicts in a predominantly white suburb of simi valley set off three days of riots in predominantly african-american neighborhoods. by the time it was over, 55 people were dead, more than 2,000 were hurt, and property damage exceeded $1 billion. two of the officers were later convicted of federal civil rights charges, and king won $3.8 million in damages from the city in a civil suit. king was on parole for robbery at the time of the beating and has had several run-ins with the law in the ensuing years. he served a 90-day jail term in 1996 for a hit-and-run involving his wife at the time, and pleaded guilty in 2004 to reckless driving and driving under the influence of a controlled substance. in march, he was cited for driving without a license after being pulled over in arcadia, california. earlier this year, in a cnn documentary, king spoke to cnn's don lemon about his struggle with alcohol abuse. i'll always have an issue when it comes to alcohol. my dad was an alcoholic, the addiction part is in my blood, king said. what i've learned to do is to arrest my -- addiction, arrest it myself, so i don't get arrested.

" in the rixos hotel, karadsheh wasn't ready for life's wild ride to end. phoning home to say goodbye it had become apparent days earlier that the journalists -- from an array of news organizations, including bbc, reuters, fox and china's cctv -- were prisoners of a dying gadhafi regime. the government officials and minders who'd monitored the journalists abandoned the hotel august 21. about 15 gunmen loyal to the regime remained behind, roaming the halls with russian assault rifles. they told the journalists they could not leave the hotel. most of the loyalists were irritable, young, reckless. they adorned their weapons with the green flag of gadhafi's regime. to avoid contact with this volatile bunch, the journalists moved to an upper floor. a hotel chef initially took care of the group. one 21-year-old gunman -- a nice guy, karadsheh says -- ran through the hotel with his jeans covered in the blood of his cousin, killed in the fighting outside. by monday, tensions between the journalists and their captors escalated. gunfire erupted outside the hotel, and smoke could be seen coming from the direction of gadhafi's nearby compound. the gunmen were enraged. nato spies, they shouted. there are spies amongst the journalists! they walked amid the journalists, their guns drawn. they were angry, bitter. this could really turn out terribly for us, chance thought. the journalists tried not to antagonize. we all had a calm panic, if there is such a thing, he recalled. the gunmen's belligerence sparked paranoia about being taken hostage, about being held prisoner, about being executed. it dawned on us: if they'd been given orders to take us as prisoners or to execute us, there was nothing we could do. that loss of control -- the realization that their fate rested with the men holding guns -- led to the darkest thoughts: that they wouldn't make it out alive. chance phoned his mother and wife to tell them what to do with his remains. his wife put his 5-year-old daughter on the line. if this was a final goodbye, his only child needed to hear daddy's voice. the veteran correspondent who has covered conflicts in the balkans, chechnya, iraq and afghanistan didn't tell his girl about the danger he faced. he spoke instead of the new school year. you're going to start school in two weeks, he said. promise me that you'll work really hard at school. yes, poppa, i promise you. be a good girl for me and mommy. poppa, i will. his heart sank. he was 2,000 miles from his home in moscow. he wanted nothing more than to see his girl on her first day of school. he just wasn't sure if he'd make it. fighting intensified outside. snipers fired into the hotel, shattering windows and rattling nerves. chance and the others spent 36 hours face-down on the floor with little food or water. with frequent power outages, it was difficult to follow the events of tripoli outside the walls of the hotel. but work kept chance focused. he tweeted using his smartphone, used a satellite phone or called friends and dictated his thoughts. at one point tuesday, he leaned over a balcony overlooking the hotel's interior courtyard, which the gunmen patrolled. i suppose you're happy now that libyans are killing libyans, one shouted. connecting as a human the sound of artillery fire pierced the morning calm wednesday. journalists rustled awake. the gunmen had grown increasingly hostile the day before. the group worried about what lay in store. about 6 a.m., all of the gunmen except the older one left the hotel. karadsheh and the arabic-speaking cameraman approached him. a day earlier, she had overheard him telling the younger gunmen to remain calm and be good to the journalists: we want them to go back to their countries and say good things about us -- how libyans are brave people. now karadsheh and the cameraman told him what they understood: gadhafi's regime had fallen. when a man who called himself a soldier entered the hotel, the gunman asked about the situation outside. you were out there. tell me, what's really going on? is it what they are telling us? yes, he was told. the rebels were indeed in control. gadhafi's rule of libya was over. karadsheh seized the moment with an emotional plea. her family missed her, she told him, as did the families of the three dozen other journalists. think about your kids, she said. you're left here alone. just let us go. at first, the man defended gadhafi, saying that he had brought democracy to libya, that the nation thrived under his leadership. earlier, he'd told karadsheh that he was protecting the journalists. that he wanted his children to know that he'd fight to the end. karadsheh and the cameraman reminded him that all the senior officials -- and now even his young comrades -- had abandoned him. it was time to give up. slowly, he started to change. the cameraman slowly stripped the soldier and gunman of their weapons. now unarmed, the man looked at the journalists and said, you can go now. karadsheh immediately began negotiating with the international committee of the red cross to get cars to the hotel. before she left, she told the man goodbye. jomana, get out of here, he said. go back home. libya is over. there will be a bloodbath for years to come. chance watched nearby as his colleague talked with the guard. i watched this transformation these guys made from being gadhafi hardliners to realizing that his regime was a historically past moment. that was a remarkable transition to witness. i think it's the most moving part of this whole crisis. says karadsheh: in the end, we're all human. and that's what this was about, connecting with him as a human. stepping outside the rixos, the journalists worried about snipers. there were none. cars with the bbc and the international committee of the red cross pulled up. they piled inside. rixos crisis ends. all journalists are out! chance tweeted. in the car, he called cnn. speeding through tripoli, he described the end of their hellish ordeal. karadsheh sat next to him, tears streaming down her face, the weight of recent days crashing down. we wouldn't be here if it weren't for her, chance said later. but karadsheh praised the cameraman. it was a team effort. chance's daughter will soon see her poppa. he plans to be home for her first day of school september 5. but first he stopped at the newly named martyr square, where joyous tripoli residents showered him with flowers. they're not celebrating my freedom, he said. they're celebrating libya's freedom. karadsheh was struck by the disparate scene from a week ago, when tripoli was filled with unhappy faces. today, she noted, everyone seemed to wear smiles. gadhafi's images have been torn down. i came out to a new libya, she said. on thursday, the day after her release, she did the unthinkable. she returned to the hotel to gather her personal belongings. i got a bit freaked out when we got close, she said. but the first thing i saw was a rebel flag hanging on the rixos. i felt comfortable. soon, she was back in a car, crossing the border into tunisia, headed home. as she'd told the gunman, she longs to see her loved ones. cnn's paul armstrong contributed to this report.

" libya has always relied on foreign expertise to exploit its oil, but expatriate workers may be reluctant to return before the violence -- and the threat of abduction -- abates. the waters off tripoli, where heavy gunbattles continued thursday, contain important fields like the bahr essalam. but in the east, too, there are still pockets of fighters loyal to deposed leader moammar gadhafi and there are ongoing clashes. spanish oil company repsol said last month that its assets in libya were intact, but said staff would only return to the country when fighting ceased and it would take at least four weeks to resume production. marathon oil, based in houston, said it has had preliminary talks with the national transitional council about restoring production when the situation stabilizes. the worst scenario for the ntc -- and the oil companies -- is a prolonged campaign of sabotage by opponents of libya's new rulers. wood mckenzie noted that gadhafi supporters sabotaged the pumping station that moved oil from the sarir and messia fields early in the conflict and said: libya's oil fields are located in the vast, remote saharan desert, making them impossible to defend from attack. other analysts point out that only now, after a prolonged insurgency, is iraq's oil output recovering to pre-invasion levels. rehabilitating the oil industry is one of the ntc's priorities because oil has provided 95% of the state's export revenue. while libya's new rulers will benefit from the release of the old regime's assets and international aid, they need a predictable revenue stream. a short journey across the mediterranean, libya is the ideal source for southern europe, with its plentiful reserves of light sweet crude, a high-quality oil. some european refiners are not equipped to process sour crude, industry experts said, and that has intensified competition for other sources (mainly nigerian) of high-quality oil in the absence of libyan exports. however unpredictable the current situation, european oil companies are gearing up for battle. the major players from there before the uprising began were italy's eni, total of france and repsol. british giant bp is also trying to get a larger slice of libyan exploration projects. it concluded a $900 million deal with the gadhafi regime three years ago to explore for gas. other players include omv of austria and marathon. china, through its state-owned cnpc, had begun exploring off the libyan coast to help feed its insatiable appetite for africa's mineral wealth but recently terminated several contracts because of the unrest. eni has been lobbying hard to retain its dominant role, concerned that total may get preferential treatment from the new government because of france's leading role in the military campaign to oust gadhafi. company officials said eni has been in regular contact with the rebels since april and ceo paolo scaroni predicted a positive future for eni in libya. scaroni is to visit libya next week to sign an agreement to supply gas for vehicles and natural gas to make electricity. italy has moved quickly to unblock libyan assets worth more than $500 million. but there may be concern in rome that senior ntc member mahmoud jibril headed for paris before rome. some ntc officials have suggested that those states most heavily involved in the conflict against the gadhafi regime -- which include britain, france and qatar -- will have an advantage when it comes to reconstruction projects. other states -- like russia, brazil and china -- that opposed action against the gadhafi regime may find it an uphill battle with libya's new rulers. tarhouni told reuters on thursday that all current contracts would be honored. he said it was far too early to contemplate new contracts. it's the last thing on my mind, he told reuters. ntc officials have also pledged to reform the notoriously corrupt national oil company, often used as a piggy bank by the gadhafi family. "
" on thursday, diplomats will converge in istanbul for a meeting of the libya contact group, a coalition of arab and european governments. representatives from the united states and turkey will also attend. many of these governments threw their weight behind the libyan rebels by freezing the assets of libyan leader moammar gadhafi's government and pledging military and financial support to the council in benghazi. the group will discuss the next steps to be taken at the political level, said unal. it will be no surprise if they also discuss the financial aspect of the crisis. "
" state department spokeswoman victoria nuland said participants were looking forward to a high-level meeting of allies in paris next week. italy will unfreeze about $505 million in libyan assets that have been held in italian banks, italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said thursday. the rebels have already gotten some support. mustafa abdul jalil, chairman of the transitional council, revealed that turkey had sent $300 million to the rebels since july. the expected release of financing for humanitarian aid came as a few signs appeared on the streets of the capital that indicated a lessening of tensions in some neighborhoods. for the first time in days, a few stores opened and more residents were out on the streets. but fighting continued in pockets as the rebels hustled to consolidate power and much of the city remained a no-go zone. weapons littered the streets in some areas. around one intersection, a dozen bodies lay on the ground, their hands bound behind them. rebels said they had been executed by gadhafi's men, but that was not clear. the victims were black africans, who composed a large part of gadhafi's army, raising the specter of the revenge killings that clinton has cautioned against. the opposition has posted a $1.4 million bounty for gadhafi's capture or death. though he hasn't been reported seen since rebel forces began advancing last weekend into the libyan capital, he appeared to have issued another audio message in which he exhorted his followers to fight for control of the capital. tripoli is for you, men and women, the speaker said. go out, go out and free tripoli. destroy them wherever they are, fight them. let the crowds from everywhere march to tripoli. the speaker added, libya is for you and not for france or its president, nicolas sarkozy. france is a leader in the nato mission in libya. do not leave tripoli for the rats, do not leave them. fight them, destroy them. you are the overwhelming majority, you have marched in millions. march with the same millions but fight this time. fill the streets and the fields, the speaker said. gadhafi has previously described his adversaries as rats. do not be afraid of bombing, you will not be hit. do not be afraid at all. they are just stun grenades to scare you. do not be afraid at all, do not surrender tripoli. cnn cannot independently confirm who was speaking in the recording. special forces from britain, france, jordan and qatar -- on the ground in libya -- have stepped up operations in support of the rebels in tripoli and other cities. but a senior opposition official said much of the capital's southern neighborhoods remained dangerous. we have 80% of tripoli liberated, said hisham abu hajer, the coordinator of the rebels' brigades in tripoli. the two suburbs of abu salim and al hadba al khadra remain contested and fierce fighting with gadhafi forces continues. witnesses told cnn that fighting between rebels and gadhafi loyalists erupted thursday at the embattled leader's compound, the scene of a number of clashes in recent days. a giant plume of smoke rose from the compound in bab al-aziziya two days after it was seized by rebels. rebels controlled tripoli's international airport, but were struggling to secure an area east of it. gadhafi loyalists destroyed an empty libyan airline passenger plane parked at the airport thursday -- the third plane destroyed in 24 hours. the tripoli airport is under the control of the rebels, but it is still being shelled by gadhafi forces with grad missiles, abu hajer said. nato is trying to learn how many surface-to-air missiles and launchers may still be operational inside libya and who controls them, a nato official told cnn thursday. several months ago, the u.s. military estimated libya had an arsenal of 20,000 sams, but it was not clear how many may have been destroyed during the conflict and who has control of the remaining missiles. the state department's nuland also said the 10 tons of mustard gas stored at the waddan ammunition reservation in libya are secure inside massive steel containers within heavy bunkers. but nuland also referred to discussions with the transitional council about taking over external security of the facility, raising the question about who is now watching over them. a u.s. official said the same libyan government unit that had been guarding the mustard gas stockpile is still doing so, an indication that gadhafi security forces were still present. but the official said monitoring of the facility has determined they have neither abandoned their posts, nor tried to gain access to the materials. the materials are secure, guarded and not disturbed, said the official. at hospitals across tripoli, overwhelmed doctors and nurses attempt to care for the wounded. robin waudo, a spokesman for the international committee of the red cross, said two surgical teams were en route from europe with the first scheduled to arrive friday. in gadhafi's hometown of sirte, the ntc said it was negotiating with the longtime ruler's tribal leaders for their surrender without bloodshed. abu hajer said the process of moving government ministries from the opposition base in benghazi to the capital has inched forward, with about four or five ministerial level officials of the ntc already in tripoli. in the oil-rich city of al-brega, several crude oil storage tanks continued burning more than six days after they were set ablaze by retreating gadhafi troops, said ramadan shalash, the refinery fire chief. cnn's joe vaccarello, richard roth,

" as for the airport, rebels said they controlled the facility, but were struggling to secure an area east of it controlled by gadhafi loyalists. they claim gadhafi loyalists have been indiscriminately shelling the airport from a civilian village east of the facility in an effort to repel the advance of rebel forces. rebels say they are cautious in their response to the incoming fire because of the civilian casualties. one aircraft burned as loyalists resumed mortar and grad rocket shelling of the airport, according to a cnn team that witnessed the attack. this comes amid world concerns over revenge killings by rebels and loyalists. amnesty international has gathered accounts from survivors of abuse in zawiya by pro-gadhafi soldiers and rebel forces. it also issued a report on friday about the killings of detainees in tripoli by gadhafi loyalists. evidence emerged of executions in the battle for tripoli. a dozen bodies, with their hands bound behind them, were discovered near gadhafi's compound in tripoli where fierce fighting erupted thursday. rebels at the scene told cnn they had been executed by gadhafi's men, but it was not immediately clear. the victims were black africans, who composed a large part of gadhafi's army. the discovery of the bodies came a day after a doctor at a tripoli hospital told cnn that he had examined a number of dead rebels who appeared to have been executed with a bullet to the head. on the political front, the opposition national transitional council has announced it is moving its political base to tripoli from its strong in benghazi in eastern libya. libya's rebel leadership on friday pleaded urgently with the united states and other countries to unfreeze billions of dollars, saying the funds are vital to establish peace and stability in the nation. our friends throughout the world are talking about the procedures needed to bring back peace and stability, mahmoud jibril, a senior ntc leader, told reporters at an international conference in turkey. but we cannot do that unless we can fulfill our duties. his call for funds came a day after the u.n. security council's sanctions committee approved a u.s. request to free up $1.5 billion of the at least $100 billion in libyan assets frozen at the start of the war. the national transitional council has been recognized by nations and alliances across the globe. the peace and security council of the african union failed to do so at a friday meeting. neverthless, the council issued a communique that urged the formation of an inclusive transitional government. it called for the establishment of a constitutional and legislative framework for the democratic transformation of libya, as well as for support towards the organization of elections and the national reconciliation process. it encouraged the libyan stakeholders to accelerate the process leading to the formation of an all-inclusive transitional government that would be welcome to occupy the seat of libya in the au, which represents countries across africa. cnn's dan rivers, sara sidner, arwa damon, raja razek, jomana karadsheh, hada messia, barbara starr, chelsea j. carter and pam benson contributed to this report.

" he condemned the car bombing but would not speculate on who might be responsible. the attack targeted a building that housed 26 u.n. humanitarian and development agencies, he said, adding: this was an assault on those who devote their lives to helping others. ban said he was sending the deputy secretary general and the chief of u.n. security to abuja, where they will try to determine who is responsible. yushau shuaib, a spokesman for nigeria's national emergency management agency, said the driver of the vehicle used in the bombing had passed through the first and second gates of the compound before detonating the explosives by the building's reception area. a witness outside the u.n. building at the time of the attack told cnn she had seen a white suv drive quickly through the main gate of the compound. she then heard two explosions in quick succession, the second one much larger and followed by the shattering of glass. images from the scene showed severe damage to the bottom floors of the building, with windows blown in and debris scattered around. people who were in the u.n. building told cnn that after the explosion, a wall fell on some people, causing several casualties. u.k. foreign secretary william hague said he was shocked by the attack. this brutal act has killed and injured many innocent people, and i utterly condemn those who have carried it out, he said. around the world the u.n. works for peace, security and international cooperation and an attack on the u.n. is an attack on these principles. alessandra vellucci at the united nations offices in geneva, switzerland, confirmed that the u.n. premises in abuja have been bombed but was unable to give more details. the building is home to the main u.n missions operating in nigeria and may have had as many as 400 people inside. cnn's alkasim abdulkadir said the area was not very busy because it was a diplomatic district, with the liberian and u.s. embassies nearby, but there were people working there. a spokeswoman for the u.s. embassy in abuja, deborah maclean, told cnn that there had been no damage to the embassy building, which is half a mile from the u.n. building. embassy personnel were initially told to be careful in case of further violence, she said. zoran jovanovic, head of mission for the international red cross in abuja, said the explosion was heard at 10:15 a.m. the u.n. building is in a large compound that has five gates, jovanovic said, adding that the area is also home to western african embassies. it is not yet clear who was responsible for the attack. the nigerian capital has experienced a series of bombings recently. in june, a car blast killed at least five people at the police headquarters in the city. it detonated less than two minutes after the federal police chief entered the building, a security source said at the time. a month later, at least three people died in an explosion near a church outside the capital. the number of casualties could have been higher if services had still been going on, according to a police spokesman. in october, at least 12 people died when car bombs exploded as the nation celebrated 50 years of independence. the attacks near the justice ministry injured about 50. the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta claimed responsibility for the october attack. mend, an umbrella organization of several rebel groups, is battling the government for fairer distribution of oil wealth. recent attacks, including on the church and police station, may have been the work of a radical muslim sect, boko haram, the nation's officials said this year. boko haram aims to enforce a strict version of sharia law in the nation. africa's most populous nation is divided between a largely christian south and a muslim north. cnn's alkasim abdulkadir, umaro djau, christian purefoy, ben brumfield, stephanie halasz, david wilkinson and claudia rebaza contributed to this report.

(so) i said, 'this is the time. i have nothing to lose.' that summer, millet sold his construction supply business and started a program called fondaps , which stands for foundation notre-dame du perp tuel secours (foundation of our lady of perpetual help). the program uses soccer to help children stay out of trouble and learn valuable life skills. millet calls it education by sport. i want the kids to be very good citizens, he said. in soccer ... you need to give, you need to receive, you need team spirit, discipline, sportsmanship. ... it's not all about soccer, it's about life. millet started by focusing his efforts on children from solino, one of port-au-prince's most dangerous slums. but going into the neighborhood to recruit young participants was risky. my wife didn't want me to go. she said gangs (would) kill me. but millet was undeterred. i said, 'i'd rather die doing something good than die in bed.' while millet was first greeted with suspicion, he was eventually accepted by the locals and children flocked to join his program. today, hundreds of children have benefited from fondaps. do you know a hero? nominations are open for 2011 cnn heroes soccer programs for children are rare in haiti, and players generally must pay to participate. in millet's program, the equipment, uniforms, shoes and training are all free for participants. he also pays the transportation and entry fees for players to compete in soccer tournaments. when you live in the ghetto, you don't see the world outside, he said. i try to bring hope for them, ... to show them that (their) life is not only the reality. before the earthquake hit haiti in january 2010, millet's program had expanded to three neighborhoods and involved more than 600 children, including more than 150 girls. but the quake devastated solino and halted fondaps' momentum. one of the children in the program died and many lost friends and family members. when the earthquake came ... it became harder for the kids, millet said. now, most of them live in tents. ... they have to fight for everything. two of the three fields where millet had held soccer practice became large tent cities. his remaining field is located on the outskirts of port au prince -- too far for many of his former players to walk. but about 200 boys still make the journey. millet believes that the difficult times have only increased the need for his work. in port-au-prince right now, there is almost no soccer field, he said. it's very important for a kid to play. ... i try to give them joy, give them their childhood. the children, ages 9-17, practice five days a week. and millet often arranges games on sundays. when they win, they are happy and they know that it's because they worked hard for it. ... that is the message i want to tell them, said millet. sometimes you win, sometime you lose. ... but this is the way you win in life. since many of his kids, as he calls them, lack father figures, millet also acts as a role model and mentor. after practice, he and the other coaches regularly talk with the boys about what's going on in their lives. millet constantly stresses the importance of education to them, and at times dips into his own pocket to pay their school fees. they don't have to steal ... or (join a) gang. they know that they can do something. they know they can believe in themselves, said millet. while fondaps is basically a one-man operation run on a shoestring budget, millet is always looking for other ways to help his players. usually once a week, participants receive packets of pasta, rice and beans to bring home to their families. he is also working on getting a bus to transport children to practice, and he hopes to one day establish his own school with athletic fields and programs in music and art. despite the challenges to keep his program going, millet is not lacking in motivation. to see the joy in the face of a kid ... and you know what he's living (through) ... that makes me happy, he said. it's so wonderful to see the progress they make in soccer, in their own life, in everything. for jeff fouvant, millet's program has been a lifeline. the 11-year-old lost his father in the earthquake and is living in a tent with 10 family members. fouvant's entire family depends on the food he receives from fondaps, and millet also pays for his school fees. mr. patrice ... he helped us a lot, said fouvant. he is a hero. in 2009, millet's cancer returned, but he's treating it with medication. he recently spent several weeks in the u.s. undergoing radiation treatment, but he insists that he's feeling good. though cancer is a reality that millet can't escape, he said he's happier now than he was before his diagnosis. and he's determined to do as much as he can with whatever time he has left. i realized how important life is, every moment, he said. i am not ready to die yet. i have many, many things to do. want to get involved? check out the fondaps website at www.fondaps.com and see how to help.

" the cone of uncertainty -- the area that could be affected by irene depending on what path it follows over the next several days -- includes much of the northeast. even if the hurricane does not make landfall, heavy rain could trigger flooding. the biggest concern is getting people to pay attention and make sure they are ready, federal emergency management agency administrator craig fugate said in an interview with cnn. residents should have the necessary supplies and an evacuation plan ready, he said. the storm could weaken as it works its way up the u.s. east coast in the coming days. as it gets closer to the northeast, it will run into the cooler labrador current, and that -- along with some more wind shear -- should allow irene to lose some strength, said hln meteorologist bob van dillen. the u.s. navy is sending 27 ships based in norfolk, virginia, out to sea to ride out irene, a senior navy official told cnn. an aircraft carrier is among them. another 28 ships will seek more sheltered areas. three submarines were heading out to sea as well. new york mayor michael bloomberg said vulnerable patients in possibly affected hospitals, nursing homes and senior homes must be moved by 8 p.m. et friday. south carolina state officials have decided not to order evacuations but urged boaters and swimmers to stay out of the water. the last major hurricane to strike the united states was wilma in 2005, which was a category 3 at landfall in southwest florida, jeras said. cnn's josh levs, ed payne, melanie whitley, phil gast, catherine e. schoichet, joe sutton, greg botelho, chris boyette, paul corson, eden pontz, laura batchelor, barbara starr and john fricke contributed to this report.

" tokyo, japan (cnn) -- japanese prime minister naoto kan, whose approval rating tumbled following the devastating march earthquake and tsunami, announced his resignation friday. kan announced he is stepping down as party leader during a meeting with members of the ruling democratic party of japan. the party will elect a new leader next week, who will take over as prime minister. the resignation fulfills his promise to step down after parliament approved two pieces of legislation, including one related to post-earthquake reconstruction. i will put my words into action once those two bills are approved, kan said this month at a lower house committee session. kan believes the two bills -- the deficit-financing bond bill and the new energy promotion bill -- will push forward his reconstruction policies. the bills passed friday. kan has been under pressure to resign since the march 11 earthquake and tsunami and subsequent nuclear crisis in the nation. the disaster triggered the worst nuclear crisis since chernobyl, as cores overheated and spewed radioactive material into surrounding areas. soon after the disaster, ratings agency moody's put the country debt under review for a possible downgrade, as political infighting undermined measures to fix the budget deficit. moody's officially downgraded japan's credit on wednesday, citing its unstable politics in june, the embattled leader narrowly escaped a vote of no confidence in parliament. as many as nine candidates, including finance minister yoshihiko noda and former foreign minister, seiji maehara, are considered possible contenders for the post of prime minister. kan's resignation allows him to remain in office until the ruling party elects its new leader, a move scheduled for monday. a day later, parliament will vote in the new leader as prime minister, the sixth premier for the nation in five years. japan's next prime minister will inherit a series of problems, including soaring debt, nuclear woes, a shrinking population and a nation struggling to rebuild after the devastating earthquake and tsunami.

" (cnn) -- an 80-year old austrian man has been taken into custody for allegedly sexually abusing his wife and his two mentally disabled daughters for more than 40 years, police and a prosecutor said thursday. we fear that he might bother his victims or continue to abuse women, chief prosecutor alois ebner, who ordered the arrest, told cnn. the man's wife died three years ago, investigators said, but the daughters still lived with their father in the northwestern town of braunau. they slept on a wooden bench and were threatened by their father with a pitchfork, authorities said. he isolated the two women from the outside world for all the time, said ernestine heger, another prosecutor in the case. police freed the two sisters in may 2011, after a social worker brought their allegations to authorities. the man had fallen on the floor that month and could not get up, officials said, and his daughters refused to help him for two days. the women then entrusted themselves to a social worker, who informed police about the situation. after being treated in a hospital, the man was transferred to a nursing home in braunau while the case was being investigated, authorities said. the two daughters have not yet been questioned by prosecutors. according to austrian law, they can refuse to testify. in 2008, austrian josef fritzl was arrested after having imprisoned and raped his daughter for 24 years. he was convicted on charges of incest, rape, false imprisonment, assault and murder and sentenced to life in prison in 2009. the murder charge was for allowing one of the babies he fathered with his daughter to die shortly after birth. heger said that in contrast to the fritzl case, the sisters in braunau were not really imprisoned. although they could not move where they wanted, neighbors have seen them several times throughout the years, she explained. the two sisters are now in psychological care, officials said.

" in 1986, libya was implicated in the fatal bombing at a west berlin nightclub that left one american service member dead, prompting then-u.s. president ronald reagan to dub the libyan leader the mad dog of the middle east. reagan ordered the united states to bomb libya and imposed economic sanctions against the north african country. two years later, libya was implicated in the 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103, which exploded over lockerbie, scotland. years later, gadhafi appeared to moderate and seek rapprochement with the west. in 1999, he turned over suspects in the lockerbie bombing, and in 2003 the country agreed to eliminate weapons of mass destruction. in the years before the current rebellion started, gadhafi even hired a public relations firm to burnish his global image as a statesman and a reformer. starting in 2006, the leader spent about $3 million a year to execute a public relations strategy that included paying think-tank analysts and former government officials to take a free trip to libya for lectures, discussions and personal meetings with gadhafi. in 2009, he addressed the u.n. general assembly for the first and only time. in his 96-minute ramble, he denounced the security council as a terror council, suggested the h1n1 swine-flu virus was a military tool and called for renewed investigations into the assassinations of john f. kennedy and martin luther king, jr. earlier this year, as people around the middle east and north africa began to challenge their leaders in the so-called arab spring movement, gadhafi found himself a target. but while longtime egyptian president hosni mubarak was ousted after a few weeks, and even after the eastern libyan city of benghazi fell to the rebels, gadhafi fought on and blamed outsiders, armed gangs and others for the violence. in the end, the libyan leader sealed his reputation with his crackdown on protesters and attacks against rebels and civilians alike. recently, international leaders accused gadhafi's regime of committing human rights violations and killing civilians. the u.n. security council subsequently issued a no-fly zone over libya and approved all necessary measures short of invasion to protect civilians. officials in the gadhafi regime, in turn, repeatedly accused nato of killing civilians in airstrikes. in april, gadhafi wrote a letter to u.s. president barack obama, urging him to end the nato bombing of his war-torn country. gadhafi asked obama to stop what he called the unjust war against a small people of a developing country, adding that those in the opposition are terrorists and members of al qaeda. the nato operations continued, however. in june, the international criminal court issued arrest warrants for gadhafi, his son saif al-islam gadhafi, and his brother-in-law abdullah al-sanussi. the warrants are for crimes against humanity, including murder and persecution, allegedly committed across libya from february 15 through at least february 28, through the state apparatus and security forces, the court said in a statement. cnn's mike pearson, greg botelho and catherine shoichet contributed to this report.

" it also is thought to extend to a neighborhood where gadhafi forces were lobbing shells recently toward the compound after it was taken over by the rebels. the tunnel sidner saw is wide enough for adults to walk side by side. she spotted a golf cart that can easily fit in the corridors. sidner also saw a range of other sights as she strolled through the labyrinth: a thick wall, a massive door and a sturdy lock. a charred ceiling, couches and beds where a fire apparently occurred. pieces of metal and shrapnel. a section where nato bombs fell and the roof caved in. another room contained videotapes lined up on a shelf, part of a tv studio where gadhafi may have recorded messages. it's set up like a survival bunker, sidner said in an on-air report. there is literally a city under here.

" they are taking precautions, sydney jenkins, bar manager at poor richard's sandwich shop in manteo, said wednesday evening. it's now more or less whether it's even going to hit us. this is a huge storm, said cnn meteorologist jacqui jeras. the cloud field is more than 800 miles across. the tropical storm force winds extend out 200 miles from the center. the strengthening came as the storm pounded central and southeastern bahamas. rainfall of 6 to 12 inches was expected in the bahamas, with 15 inches possible in some places, the miami-based hurricane center said. at 11 p.m. et wednesday, irene was moving northwest at 12 mph and was between rum cay and long island, 150 miles east-southeast of nassau. hurricane-force winds extended up to 70 miles and u.s. weather officials predicted significant storm surge. we are urging persons in central bahamas to exercise extreme caution, said capt. stephen russell, head of the national emergency management agency in the island chain. no injuries had been reported as of wednesday evening, but extensive structural damage from wind was reported on acklins and crooked islands, russell told cnn. numerous homes had been blown off their foundations. russell had no information on rainfall amounts. electricity was out in some locations. irene whipped through the island of mayaguana, the mostly easterly island in the chain, and moved into long, san salvador and cat islands, which are not heavily populated. about 65% of the country's population is on new providence, home to nassau. projections showed the island being outside of hurricane-force winds, russell said. we hope the system makes a gradual turn to the northeast. after it makes the turn, irene could threaten large sections of the eastern seaboard, from the carolinas into the northeast. but, forecasters said, it was too soon to predict how it would affect the united states because of the cone of uncertainty. even if irene doesn't touch land or glances off the u.s. coast, the waves are going to be tremendous, said cnn meteorologist chad myers. swells generated by irene will begin affecting the southeast's coast thursday. on the forecast track, the core of irene will move across the southeastern and central bahamas through tonight and over the northwestern bahamas on thursday, the hurricane center said. irene forced more than a dozen cruise ships to change their itineraries in the caribbean, cruisecritic.com reported. those ships include the carnival sensation, which had been docked in freeport, bahamas, but was coming back to port canaveral, florida, late wednesday. irene has prompted the bahamas ministry of tourism aviation to recommend strongly that people with plans to travel to the bahamas in the next few days postpone their trips. the storm will curve northward as it nears the united states, with most of the latest projections suggesting the storm will avoid landfall until it is north of north carolina. the storm is expected to arrive off north carolina by saturday morning. the storm approaches as americans increasingly are relying on social media to prepare for and keep abreast of disasters. according to two american red cross surveys, the increased use of social media and mobile technology has caused response agencies to engage with people in times of disaster and to include information from social networks in their response efforts. north carolina coastal areas could see about 6 inches of rain and tropical storm force winds. irene is forecast to be a category 2 or 3 storm when it reaches the u.s. east coast later friday or early saturday. many counties were taking a wait-and-see attitude on evacuations. warren lee, emergency management director in new hanover county, north carolina, said shelters likely will be opened. if the storm stays on current track, we don't expect a major impact and we will not issue an evacuation order plan right now. some computer models suggest new york or new jersey could be hit. everywhere from north carolina to massachusetts remains in the cone of uncertainty, jeras said. worst-case scenario, we could be looking at two landfalls, or we could be lucky and get a brush instead of a direct hit. ... even if irene doesn't make landfall in the united states, it may very well bring flooding rains, damaging winds and power outages to the northeast. planning is critical, and everyone needs to be ready with a disaster plan and a safety kit. chris martin, an employee at endeavor seafood in newport, rhode island, said a bridal shower is scheduled sunday in portsmouth for his fiancee. we're hoping to have it outside. martin is hoping the hurricane, if it actually affects the state, will not arrive until monday. hyde county, in north carolina's outer banks, declared a state of emergency for ocracoke island and the county's mainland, along with a mandatory evacuation for all visitors and a voluntary evacuation for residents. the mandatory evacuation will extend to residents beginning 5 a.m. thursday, hyde county emergency services said. ocracoke is reachable only by boat or private plane. while forecasts showed the storm moving further from the coast and toward the sea, north carolina gov. beverly perdue said wednesday, we must all prepare for the worst. in kill devil hills in the outer banks, locals who insist on staying through the storm were planning hurricane parties as they stocked up on water, canned food and flashlight batteries, said cnn ireporter penelope penn, who was in the area tuesday. the water was so calm and the sky so clear at the outer banks last night. it truly is calmest before a storm, penn added. on wednesday, penn was in nearby virginia beach, virginia. the last major hurricane to strike the united states was wilma in 2005, which was a category 3 at landfall, jeras said. hurricane katrina, earlier the same year, was also a category 3 at landfall. the most recent hurricane to make landfall in the united states was ike in 2008, which hit near galveston, texas, as a category 2. gloria in 1985 was the most recent hurricane to hit new york. it was a category 3 at landfall, the national hurricane center said. in 1991, hurricane bob hit massachusetts, a category 2 at landfall. bill read, director of the hurricane center, said irene could cause problems with flooding in northeastern states that have already had lots of rainfall this summer. widespread damage is possible from the coastal carolinas all the way up to the canadian maritimes, including the major cities of the northeast, cnn meteorologist dave hennen said. irene is expected to pass well east of florida, so only minimal effects are expected thursday and friday as the storm moves northward toward the carolinas. but the u.s. coast guard is worried boaters in south florida are taking the threat too lightly. officials expect heavy rip currents and beach erosion in miami. the most prudent thing to make sure mariners are not out this time tomorrow, capt. chris scraba said. south carolina state officials decided not to order evacuations. boaters and swimmers were urged by the coast guard to stay out of the water. cnn's ed

" la paz, bolivia (cnn) -- bolivia's government is accusing u.s. officials of meddling in the south american nation's internal affairs and fueling indigenous protests of a proposed highway project. an influential bolivian official called wednesday for the expulsion of the u.s. agency of international development, accusing the agency of promoting actions aimed at destabilizing the government. the expulsion of usaid should be ... an act of sovereignty, said juan ramon quintana, director of a bolivian government development agency and a former top presidential aide. his remarks came as hundreds of indigenous protesters trekked toward la paz, protesting the proposed construction of a highway through a national park where indigenous communities live. quintana showed documents that he said proved that officials from the agency were behind the movement. on sunday, bolivian president evo morales said the u.s. embassy officials had suspiciously been in touch with protest organizers -- pointing to a phone log that he said proved it. but embassy officials have denied supporting the protests, which are scheduled to last for weeks. we emphasize that neither the united states embassy in bolivia nor any other element of the u.s. government has given any support to the indigenous march, the u.s. embassy said in a statement. usaid did not immediately respond to a request for comment. the agency's website says it provided $52 million in aid money to bolivia in the 2010 fiscal year for projects related to health, development, economic growth and the environment. opposition politicians accuse morales and his government of using the united states as a scapegoat as a way to deflect attention away from issues raised by indigenous groups morales purports to defend. they are violating fundamental rights, the right to privacy, they are flagrantly violating it, said jaime navarro, a representative in the national unity party. and once again the government dusts off an old ghost when it finds itself facing situations like this, and tries to show a conspiracy. sacha llorenti, bolivia's interior minister, said the phone log was obtained legally. bolivia and the united states have had diminished relations since september 2008, when each country expelled the other's ambassador. morales, a strong proponent of the cultivation of coca plants -- the source of cocaine -- expelled the u.s. drug enforcement administration a month later. he also delivered a strong verbal criticism of the u.s. government at the united nations general assembly that year. last month morales told cnn en espa ol that he was afraid the u.s. government was plotting against him. days earlier, he told a convention of female of farm workers that he was worried u.s. authorities would plant something on his presidential plane while he attended the u.n. general assembly meeting in new york. they are preparing something to discredit us with drug trafficking, he said. journalist gloria carrasco contributed to this report.

" some of the worst-hit areas were cat, san salvador and long islands, each of which took direct hits, according to gayle outten-moncur of the national emergency management agency. there has been bad flooding in some areas, she said, in part due to storm surges. specifically, outten-moncur noted that there were reports of between two and three feet of water in homes on cat island, which is about 130 miles southeast of nassau and paradise island. on northern cat island, bahamas information services reported that a police station's roof had blown off. on the island of mayaguana, meanwhile, several churches reported damage that included some lost roofs, said the national emergency management agency. a high school's roof blew off on crooked island, where part of st. john the baptist church collapsed. and several homes were blown away on acklins island, part of the destruction of a large portion of the lovely settlement, according to the emergency management agency. even as the clean-up began, the bahamas ministry of tourism tried to reassure travelers that the islands should largely be open for business soon -- especially in new providence and grand bahama island, the site of freeport and the area closest to miami. in a statement late thursday afternoon, the ministry said an initial assessment ... on major tourism areas in nassau and grand bahama island indicates limited damage and points to a quick return to normal operations. specifically, the ministry said that cruise ports in both locales should open late thursday, with ships set to resume stopping there by saturday. government offices and banks will reopen monday. airports on those two islands should resume operations friday, it said, and assessments are under way on the other, mostly smaller airports elsewhere in the chain. the ministry noted that 6,000 guests made it through the storm at the country's largest resort, atlantis, adding that other resorts will be open for business as early as tomorrow. electricity remained out thursday afternoon for two-thirds of the customers on new providence, including von maur in nassau, who noted that cell phone service has continued uninterrupted. he said he's breathing easier knowing that his family, neighbors and friends appear to have escaped uninjured. and he said he was impressed by the hurricane's fury. once everybody knows everybody's ok, (a hurricane) is pretty awesome, he said. cnn's jim spellman in nassau, and greg botelho and phil gast in atlanta contributed to this report.

" (cnn) -- at least 53 people were killed and eight others injured in a reported grenade attack thursday at a casino in monterrey, mexico, the capital of nuevo leon, red cross officials said. the incident occurred around 4 p.m. local time (5 p.m. et) at the casino royale when two people aboard a vehicle arrived, and one threw three grenades into the building. there were conflicting unconfirmed reports from local media that the assailants poured gasoline on the building before setting it on fire. between 20 and 30 people were trapped in the casino because of debris from the explosions, said cmdr. angel flores with the green cross. video from the scene showed a burned-out building as firefighters made rescue attempts to break the wall of the facade of the casino to release the smoke inside the building. authorities had suspended rescue efforts thursday night for fear that the building could collapse. mexican president felipe calderon sent the following statement from his official twitter account (translated from spanish): with deep consternation, i express my solidarity with nuevo leon and the victims of this abhorrent act of terror and barbarism. he added more: these reprehensible acts require us all to persevere in the fight against gangs of unscrupulous criminals. all the support to nl (nuevo leon). about five families were outside the casino waiting for information from authorities, local journalist javier estrada reported. gustavo madrazo was one of those waiting outside the casino. he said his wife, martha, and her sister, miriam gonzalez, were inside. authorities have not identified any of the victims. so far, no representative for the company that manages the casino had arrived outside. the mexican army and state and municipal police forces were also on the scene. alejandro poire, mexico's top national security spokesman, said the federal government has made contact with local officials and that calderon has spoken to the governor of nuevo leon to offer support. poire said those who carried out the attacks will be held responsible. they will pay for their crimes. ... we will do absolutely everything ... to restore tranquility. the national commission on human rights in mexico sent a news release saying it has opened an investigation regarding the response to the events at the casino. the priority is to help safeguard the human rights enshrined in the constitution of the united mexican states and international treaties. the commission again makes clear that the insecurity in the country requires public officials responsible for implementing and enforcing the law, carry out preventive actions to protect society and away from any violence. the national commission will monitor the actions taken by the competent authorities to respond adequately to the aggrieved persons. the nhrc says it has also sent personnel to the scene including physicians, psychologists and lawyers to work jointly with authorities. nuevo leon, in northeastern mexico, has seen several grenade attacks so far this year. on august 13, four civilians were wounded when an armed group fired two grenades at a jail in the municipality of apodaca. in july, gunmen entered a downtown bar in monterrey and shot 20 people dead. a public safety spokesman told cnn the attack was likely sparked by a dispute between organized crime groups for control of the el sabino gordo nightclub, where drugs were allegedly sold. nuevo leon and the neighboring states of coahuila and tamaulipas have been the scene of a series of clashes between organized crime groups. the gulf cartel and los zetas are vying for control of trafficking routes into the united states. in november 2010, the federal government launched the coordinated operation northeast, which involves sending more security forces to the area to tackle crime. cnn's nick valencia contributed to this report "

" islamabad, pakistan (cnn) -- the son of slain gov. salman taseer was kidnapped friday afternoon in a wealthy neighborhood in the city of lahore, police said. shahbaz taseer was abducted from his car as he was on the way to his office, senior police official abdul razaq cheema told reporters. lahore police chief ahmad raza tahir, appearing on pakistani television, told reporters that a squad of 16 security personnel had been provided to taseer for protection, as he had earlier reported receiving a series of anonymous threats. however, a provincial minister told reporters that the security detail was not with taseer during the kidnapping. he said four armed men abducted taseer in the gulberg neighborhood, blocking his car with a motorcycle and a four-wheel drive vehicle. taseer ran several family businesses after the death of his father. salman taseer was a renowned businessman and governor of punjab province who was assassinated by one of his own security guards earlier this year. police say bodyguard mumtaz qadri confessed to gunning down taseer because of the governor was critical of the country's blasphemy law. the controversial legislation has been criticized by some as being used to entrap minorities.

" strauss-kahn case: what next for accuser and accused? by laura smith-spark , cnn before his arrest, dominique strauss-kahn was considered a front-runner to enter the race for president of france. story highlights dominique strauss-kahn may seek to rehabilitate his political career in france he still faces a civil lawsuit in new york and a possible attempted rape case in france nafissatou diallo is still thinking about what to do next with her life, a pastor says questions are raised about her status after claims she lied in federal applications (cnn) -- since france's dominique strauss-kahn was arrested in new york three months ago on sexual assault charges, the drama surrounding his case has gripped the united states, france and the world. the case appeared to pit the word of the archetypal powerful white man against that of a poor black woman, in the form of his accuser, hotel maid and immigrant nafissatou diallo. the criminal charges against the former french finance minister were finally dropped tuesday by prosecutors in manhattan, who said they doubted diallo's credibility. but where does that leave both protagonists in this lurid drama, played out on the global media stage? for strauss-kahn, who stepped down as head of the international monetary fund amid the scandal, tuesday's news was a cause for celebration. this is the end of an unjust and terrible test. i'm relieved for my wife, my children, my friends and all those who've supported me, he said. i can hardly wait to return to my country but first i still have a few things to do before being able to leave. i will explain myself more fully once i return. what he will say once he is back in france is not clear -- but his legal troubles are not yet over. strauss-kahn must remain in the united states for at least another 30 days to allow for an appeal against the decision to drop the charges. meanwhile, a civil case filed against him by diallo is still pending. investigators in france are also considering whether to prosecute him for attempted rape over a complaint filed by writer tristane banon, in relation to an alleged incident in paris in 2003. and a lawyer for diallo, thibault de montbrial, opened up a new front in the legal battle tuesday when he filed charges in france accusing a member of strauss-kahn's staff of putting pressure on a woman in the paris suburb of sarcelles not to testify against him in the new york case. aside from the legal issues, strauss-kahn must also overcome the damage done to his reputation if he hopes to recapture his political trajectory. before his arrest, he was considered a front-runner to win the socialist party's nomination to run for president against the incumbent nicolas sarkozy next year. but despite the joy at tuesday's news expressed by some of his fellow party members -- notably martine aubry, who is now seeking the socialist nomination in his place -- observers say he may not find it easy to regain his former status. the political game for strauss-kahn in france is over. all his strongest supporters inside the party know about it, said christian malard, a journalist for broadcaster france 3. now i don't mean he won't have a role -- i'm convinced that behind the scenes, behind the curtain, he will be a kind of godfather, a kind of referee, because it's still remembered by most of the socialist voters, by the electorate, that he is the man who was definitely given as a strong potential winner for the next presidential election, beating sarkozy in all circumstances. although he may retain some backstage influence, his image in the eyes of the broader french public is undoubtedly tarnished. a poll by ipsos-le point published on monday suggested only 28% of people held a favorable view of him. adele smith, the new york correspondent for french newspaper le figaro, says he will also have a hard job winning support for a return to the global stage -- especially from americans. they don't look at sexual relationships in the same way as we do in france, they have a more puritanical psyche, she said. whatever transpired in the sofitel hotel suite in may -- and the truth of that encounter may never be known -- the future for diallo, who lives in the bronx area of new york with her 15-year-old daughter, is uncertain. having decided to give up the anonymity usually accorded to sexual assault accusers by the media, the 32-year-old guinean stepped well and truly into the limelight with interviews last month for newsweek magazine and abc news. this will make it very difficult for her to return to any kind of normal life, said the rev. a.r. bernard, of the brooklyn-based christian cultural center. his new york megachurch, which is attended by diallo's lawyer, kenneth thompson, has publicly backed diallo, a muslim. she appeared there with the pastor last month to address the press after giving up her anonymity. she is thinking through what she will do next, how she will continue her life, bernard told cnn, saying he expected to speak to diallo soon and that she did not yet know if her employers at the hotel would keep her on in light of tuesday's news. she took a big risk to speak out publicly, bernard says, but it was motivated by the belief that the district attorney would eventually drop her case and she would be left with only the stigma of the claims against her. she told a compelling story, he said of diallo. it was not for me to judge -- the only reason i got involved was because i wanted fairness in the case and i felt she should be heard by a jury, and the district attorney shouldn't (be the one to) decide. he sees what has happened in her case as damaging to all women, who may now fear that any past indiscretions will be used to discredit their claims of a crime against them -- and says the need for justice transcends questions of religious affiliation. as for diallo, he said, she has not just physical healing necessary -- because there was medical evidence that she was assaulted -- but she also has a lot of emotional and spiritual healing that has to take place. diallo has not spoken publicly since district attorney cyrus vance's decision, but her lawyer told cnn's don lemon tuesday that she was devastated by it. she has told the truth about what happened in that hotel room, thompson said. she can't understand why manhattan district attorney cyrus vance would abandon her. she and her daughter have been crying through the night. he added: clearly, the d.a. looked at dominique strauss-kahn, his status, his power. if dominique strauss-kahn was a bus driver from the south bronx or a construction worker from harlem or a plumber ... do you think that manhattan district attorney cyrus vance would care what was in miss diallo's asylum application? questions have been raised about diallo's legal status in the united states in light of the claims by prosecutors that she lied on an asylum application and in tax filings. they also said she had claimed she was gang-raped by soldiers in her native country, but later admitted it never happened. defense attorney bruce barket, in new york's garden city, told cnn she appeared to have quite a problem, as the prosecutors' claims that she lied on federal forms could lead to her being prosecuted in manhattan for false statements or perjury. if she lied on her immigration papers, she could also face possible deportation, he said. whether that is pursued may depend on whether the authorities choose to let the whole scandal die down or risk stirring it all up again as she defends her case, he added. meanwhile, lawyers for strauss-kahn say diallo will face an uphill struggle to take forward the civil case against him, filed in the bronx, in the weeks to come. she doesn't have much, if any, chance in a civil case, william taylor told cnn's piers morgan on tuesday night. the same difficulties, the same lies will come back to haunt her in a civil case. smith, for le figaro, said strauss-kahn's lawyers seem to be gearing up for a big fight in the civil case, perhaps seeing that as a chance to restore his image. but she doubts that diallo will be deported if prosecutors' claims that she lied in her asylum application prove to be true, saying the political fallout for the new york authorities would be too great. much has been said to discredit diallo and, at the same time, people are hurting too much as a result of the poor economy to care greatly about others, she said. but there is a little support for diallo's plight among the city's residents. whatever happens, people can't help looking at things through the racial, gender and class frame, she said. they can't help looking at it as a rich white guy who had sex -- forced or not forced -- with a poor black woman from the bronx. for people here, it is outrageous. cnn's atika shubert, don lemon and saskya vandoorne contributed to this report.

" (cnn) -- a global human rights monitoring group urged libya's national transitional council on wednesday to take urgent steps to avoid lawlessness and reprisals against supporters of strongman moammar gadhafi. human rights watch sent letters to mahmoud jibril, the rebel government's prime minister, and mustafa abdul jalil, chairman of the council, asking them oversee a political transition in libya that respects human rights. the national transitional council has set a good tone for the transition with forceful statements about justice and human rights, said sarah leah whitson, middle east and north africa director at human rights watch. but concrete steps are urgently needed to avoid revenge, protect vulnerable people and help promote the rule of law. mansour el-kikhia, a libyan scholar and dissident, said the transitional council is working to minimize revenge killings, though some have already occurred. he cited conversations earlier in the day with ntc members as his source. if you are put in jail by somebody and you were tortured, you're going to remember the person who kidnapped you, he said. it's very difficult to control them. el-kikhia said the council intends to apply the rule of law. human rights watch urged the council to step up security to protect pro-gadhafi libyans, those displaced from rebel-held territories and those accused of serving as mercenaries on behalf of the libyan leader. the organization also asked the council to protect prisons, police stations, courthouses and other government institutions that became symbols of gadhafi's repression and also documents that could be invaluable in proving government accountability in past deeds and abuses. it wants to avoid what happened after the fall of iraq's saddam hussein in 2003, when many government buildings were looted and damaged and documents were destroyed. the letters sent to the council also asked the following: -- treat all detainees humanely and in accordance with international laws. -- cooperate with the international criminal court. -- consider a united nations role in post-war libya. "
" however, they said monday that one of the other two, mohammed gadhafi, had escaped. and saif al-islam gadhafi -- a top adviser to his father -- made an appearance before international journalists early tuesday to refute reports of his arrest. where is libya's leader, and how long can he hold out? there was no immediate comment from ntc officials on saadi gadhafi's status or his offer, made a day after rebel forces overran his father's bab al-aziziya compound and claimed control over nearly all of tripoli. libyan government officials have made several previous cease-fire offers during the course of the six-month revolt against gadhafi's 42-year rule.

" (cnn) -- the african union plans to host a delayed summit thursday to raise funds for famine victims amid mounting criticism over the continent's weak response to the disaster. the meeting originally planned for august 9 was postponed this month even as the organization called on urgent aid to the drought-struck horn of africa region. urgent humanitarian assistance is crucial to alleviate the impact of the drought, which has deprived people from water, sanitation, health, basic food and nutritional needs, the 54-nation body said in a statement announcing the delay. it did not give a reason for postponing the meeting, which will be held at its headquarters in addis ababa, ethiopia. a drought in the horn of africa region straddling ethiopia, kenya and somalia has left nearly 12 million people in need of assistance. somalia is especially badly hit, with a famine declared in some parts of the nation. relief efforts in somalia have been hindered by the ongoing battle between islamist rebels and the transitional government, which holds little sway beyond mogadishu. aid agencies have urged the international community to ramp up help as thousands flee somalia each week in search of food and water -- many walking for days in the sweltering sun to refugee camps in kenya and ethiopia. the meeting comes as aid groups urge the continent's leaders to step up their efforts. the african union has so far pledged only $500,000 for the aid effort, and most key governments have pledged even less or nothing at all, oxfam said in a statement this month. only a handful of african nations have donated to the effort, according to oxfam.

" mother: didn't know 13-year-old daughter was working for zetas from belen zapata , cnnmexico the girl has been released because mexican law says only offenders older than 14 are subject to serving time in jail. story highlights she is not to blame, mother says of girl, who confessed to working for a drug cartel the girl says she said was the only member of her family who was working for the zetas she says she kept track of who came and went in a town in zacatecas mexico city (cnn) -- seated in a room of the attorney general's office in the western mexico state of jalisco, a woman waits to be reunited with her 13-year-old daughter. two weeks before, the girl had run away from home. her mother thought that she was out there with her boyfriend. but the newspaper that a neighbor took her told a different story: the eldest of her six children belonged to the criminal group of drug traffickers, the zetas, and had been detained the previous weekend during a confrontation between police and gunmen. in an interview with cnnmexico, the woman, who asked not to be identified, said she did not know whether her daughter was involved in alleged criminal activities -- although the girl confessed to the contrary. the woman traveled from the nearby state of zacatecas to guadalajara, in jalisco, to see her daughter. the first thing i did, when i found out, was try to support my daughter, come for her, to show that she is not guilty of anything, because she is a girl, the woman said. we all feel very bad over the news, but we know that she is not to blame, she is a girl incapable of doing so much. in a statement before the public prosecutor and later before reporters, the girl said she had spent a month working for organized crime. she said that her work -- which paid some $800 for the month -- consisted of keeping track of who entered and left luis moya, a community of about 10,000 residents located in the south of zacatecas in central mexico. the girl said that she reported to a 22-year-old woman known as la chaparra, who has since been arrested by state and federal police. guarded by two police officers, each nearly twice her height, the teenager -- wearing jeans and a sweatshirt -- was taken before reporters. before her sat a table laden with the arsenal allegedly seized in the operation during which she was arrested. her parents were not there. the reporters questioned her: what cartel were you working for? for the zetas. does your family know this? yes. what did they tell you? that i should leave. how much were they paying you? 4,000 (pesos) every two weeks. since when? since a month ago. how did you enter? by necessity. the girl said that her mother had introduced her to la chaparra. nevertheless, she said that she was the only member of her family who was working for the zetas. the girl was taken to the facilities of the jalisco delegation of the attorney general's office, where she remained for three days before being released because the law of integral justice for adolescents of the state of jalisco stipulates that only offenders older than 14 are subject to serving time in jail. the alleged youthful member of the zetas was taken before the first court of minors of jalisco, who must establish the conditions for her rehabilitation. but she will be able to work toward her rehabilitation at home, under the vigilance of her mother and tutor. as the only person responsible for her family, the mother said she works 12 hours per day in activities that she prefers not to divulge. she said her schedule had kept her from keeping track of what her daughter is doing after the school day has ended. the woman said she knows that her daughter skipped her high school classes a few times and had been expelled due to what the school called rebellious conduct. but she said her daughter had vowed afterward to improve, and has gotten good grades -- good enough to be awarded a scholarship by the mexican government. she's a very intelligent girl, but -- as with all children her age -- a little rebellious, a little restless, but she is a very good girl, the mother said. from now on, the mother added, she will be more aware of what her daughter is doing, and she will help with her daughter's rehabiliation. the employment of children by mexican cartels is no longer a novelty in the country. eduardo guerrero gutierrez, consultant and security analyst, said that such criminal groups recruit principally young people. the youths are not contracted directly by the cartel, rather by groups that work for them, who recruit, train, pay and -- if they show potential -- incorporate them in jobs of greater responsibility to convert them into assassins, he said. last month, in the state of morelos, a 14-year-old boy was sentenced to three years in a mexican prison and a fine of 4.5 million pesos (about $400,000) for crimes that included homicide, possession of a weapon, kidnapping and organized crime. witnesses testified that the boy had tortured and decapitated four men. linked to the south pacific cartel, the boy said he had joined organized crime at age 11. the teenager's age -- and his on-camera description of the slayings -- brought international attention to the case. analysts said the dramatic example showed how mexican drug gangs were increasingly recruiting youths. in mexico, minors who have committed serious crimes receive lighter sentences than those imposed on adults. some critics believe that, to dissuade minors from engaging in criminal activity, the law ought to lower the age of criminal responsibility from 18 to 16.

" tuscany was one of the hardest-hit regions, as german troops retreated north following the liberation of rome. fulvetti estimates 3,650 people died there, the majority in june 1944. the war on civilians was triggered by benito mussolini's downfall in july 1943 when the fascist dictator was arrested, paving the way for italy's armistice with the allies. tens of thousands of italian soldiers who had fought under mussolini then took up arms to fight nazi germany. in march 1944, partisans in rome attacked a column of ss police officers, killing 33 germans. on orders from german high command, 335 men and boys were rounded up and executed at the ardeatine caves, near rome. the reprisal killings set the stage for how germany would conduct the remainder of the war in italy. troops were ordered to retaliate against civilians as punishment for partisan actions, fulvetti said. any form of resistance by civilians was cause for punishment, even simply refusing to shelter or feed german troops. clashes between local resistance and german troops near san pancrazio spread fear of reprisals throughout the countryside. they came on june 29, when units of the notorious hermann goering division stormed into homes and rounded up villagers in the town square. goffredo cinelli, who had served in italy's air force before mussolini's ouster, hid in the attic, as his father was led away. i heard the women and children crying, he said. my mother later said she went to speak to my father. a soldier turned her back and told her they were taking him to be tortured. she and my father both cried. the men's actual fate soon became clear. inside the cellar of a farmhouse, the local priest pleaded for his parishioners' lives. after saying mass, he was the first to die by gunfire at close range. the others were similarly executed. the germans later set fire to the corpses, and to villagers' homes. that same day, 173 people were killed in the nearby villages of cornia and civitella. gabriella panzieri lost several family members in the san pancrazio massacre. six years old at the time, she describes taking refuge in the woods with her mother. i remember the flames rising from our village that night. it was like the whole world was on fire, she said. allied troops reached san pancrazio, by then reduced to rubble, two weeks later. after the war, in 1946, a military court sentenced a former ss commander to life in prison for the ardeatine caves massacre. but plans for further trials were soon shelved. the approaching cold war dampened enthusiasm for ferreting out nazi war criminals. there was a growing reluctance to embarrass germany, said dr. paolo pezzino, who teaches contemporary history at the university of pisa. international justice took a back seat to realpolitik. the communists were now the enemy. it was no longer the case to look back at the past but to face the future. silence reigned for half a century. then, in 1994, a startling discovery was made at the military tribunal in rome. a forgotten archive revealed a treasure trove of evidence on hundreds of wartime atrocities, documented by allied and italian investigators. pezzino served as consultant to a parliamentary commission that looked into the motives behind the files' concealment. he maintains that if they had been properly forwarded to the military courts immediately after the war, more war crime trials could have resulted. this was a cover-up in every sense of the word, he added. the discovery of the so-called cabinet of shame triggered public outcry -- and a renewed call for justice. i felt i had a moral obligation to provide answers, said marco de paolis, currently italy's chief military prosecutor, who played a key role in reopening war crime cases. and to bring a sense of justice to hundreds of people who had been waiting over 50 years. since 2002, de paolis has tried more than a dozen cases, several resulting in convictions. by 2007, all but one defendant accused in the san pancrazio massacre had died. max josef milde, 82 when the trial started, was tried in absentia, convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the shooting deaths of 203 of the men, women and children in san pancrazio, civitella and cornia. when the sentence was pronounced, i felt the cry of justice, recalled mayor sauro testi, who accompanied survivors and family members to the sentencing. the state had finally responded. milde has always maintained his innocence, and has not shown up to serve his sentence. while german authorities helped with the case, germany does not extradite its citizens convicted of war crimes in other countries. still, his conviction was welcomed by many victims' families. it was an historic moment in which someone was declared guilty, says michele panzieri, who lost several family members to the tragedy. it's important to never forget, but you have to forgive in the end. cinelli, now 92, the air force veteran whose father was killed in the massacre, had a different reaction. i knew nothing would be resolved in the end. after 60 years? he shrugged. it was a time when there was enormous hate between those who were fascist and those who weren't. it was a tremendous struggle. even after the conviction, san pancrazio refuses to forget its past. every year, villagers hold a candlelight procession on the anniversary of the tragedy, to remember the victims. read no hate at memorial michele panzieri's father, enzo, is president of a local association dedicated to preserving the memory of the tragedy. he was an infant when the front swept through tuscany and took with it the father he never knew. on a recent afternoon, he could be seen talking to a group of students inside the farmhouse cellar -- now a museum -- answering their questions with restrained candor and insight. i enjoy talking to the kids and sometimes i've seen them get emotional, panzieri said. the youth of today will lead italy tomorrow. they need to see these things so they're never repeated.

" london (cnn) -- british health authorities on friday urged vigilance after packages of an over-the-counter painkiller were found to contain antipsychotic drugs. the antipsychotic seroquel xl was inside packets of the painkiller nurofen plus, the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency warned. three defective packets have been found so far, all in pharmacies in south london, but more than 16,000 more could potentially be affected, the agency said. each packet contains 32 tablets. nurofen plus, made by reckitt benckiser, can be bought without a prescription and has silver and black packaging. it is used for short-term relief of acute pain and contains codeine. the seroquel xl 50mg tablets, manufactured by astrazeneca, are prescription only and used to treat such illnesses as schizophrenia, mania and bipolar depression. two people are known to have taken seroquel xl tablets from one of the affected nurofen plus packets, a spokeswoman for reckitt benckiser said. in the other two cases, people noticed the boxes contained seroquel xl before taking any tablets, she added. a spokesman for the regulatory agency told cnn it could not rule out sabotage, but at the moment believed it was an issue to do with the packaging of drugs by wholesalers rather than a manufacturing problem. we haven't ruled out sabotage as of yet, but the investigation is still at an early stage, he said. common side effects of seroquel xl include dizziness, headaches and weight gain, he said. reckitt benckiser, the maker of nurofen plus, said it was taking the issue very seriously. it appears that all the standard blister strips of nurofen plus tablets have been removed and replaced with foil sealed blister strips of seroquel xl, said a statement from the company issued by public relations firm virgo health. nurofen plus and seroquel xl are not manufactured or packaged by the same company, or in the same factory, and therefore serious investigations are currently under way to establish the source of the problem, the statement said. after careful review of the manufacturing system, manufacturing errors by the makers of nurofen plus or seroquel xl are not thought to be part of the cause at this stage. astrazeneca, the maker of seroquel xl, also ruled out manufacturing errors and said it was working with the mhra and reckitt benckiser to find out what happened. patient safety is our primary concern and we are taking this issue seriously, astrazeneca said in a statement. the regulatory agency urged those who have bought nurofen plus to check the packaging of tablets within the box carefully. anyone who has taken a tablet and has questions should consult their physician, the drug regulatory body's statement said. three batches of nurofen plus are affected by the alert, the mhra said. they are batch numbers 13jj, expiry date 03/2014; 57jj, expiry date 05/2014; and 49jj, expiry date 05/2014. cnn's laura smith-spark contributed to this report.

" it is not clear who the victims were. were they among the 1,600 civilians or 370 security forces slain in the unrest? the posting on the video says the bodies are anti-government forces being dumped by thugs loyal to president bashar al-assad. syrian state tv has aired the video, saying that the bodies are being dumped by anti-government protesters. a banner said the incident took place in hama over the orontes river. razan zaitouneh, a syrian activist, said activists doubt the incident could have happened at the hama location because the river is dry at this time of year. but one prominent anti-government activist, who asked not to be named because of the dangers that could arise from the release of the information, told cnn the state tv account was correct. the bodies are those of syrian secret police killed by syrian fighters from iraq who have joined the anti-government fight, said the activist, who gets information about the goings-on in syria from an extensive network of informants. that same activist stressed that the antagonists are not representative of the protest movement. violent fringe elements have appeared during the syrian tumult. one study last month from the international crisis group said some anti-government elements have taken up arms. however, that report said, the vast majority of casualties have been peaceful protesters, and the vast majority of the violence has been perpetrated by the security services. the activist said the emergence of this video is a double-edged sword for protesters. on the one hand, the peaceful demonstrators need to become aware of the existence of fringe elements, he said. this would encourage more people to reject both the regime and these types of attacks and maintain the aims of peaceful protest, he said. at the same time, he added, the incident gives credence to the syrian government's assertion that it is targeting armed gangs. such violence, he said, could cause the international community to hesitate in continuing its mounting pressure against the syrian regime.

" the national transitional council, the rebel leadership, says it is determined to flush him out with minimal civilian losses. we don't want to spill a lot of blood, you know, because they are our brothers, one rebel fighter said. at a nearby intersection, a dozen bodies lay in the sun, some of them with their hands bound. rebel fighters say the men were executed by gadhafi's retreating forces. but the bodies appear to be those of black africans, who made up a large portion of the pro-gadhafi forces, raising questions about whether the men may have been executed by the rebels. to the south of the compound, which is located near tripoli's mediterranean shore, fighting between rebel fighters and gadhafi loyalists persisted. snipers and mortar shells continued to inflict casualties on hundreds of civilians, said kirstie campbell, a worker for the international medical corps in tripoli. i've worked in war zones for 10 years, but this is pretty bad, she said. cnn's dan rivers and thomas evans contributed to this report.
