" (cnn) -- the bodies of a man and a girl were found inside a vehicle belonging to a suspect in an amber alert case, authorities said. authorities believe 2-year-old madeline samaan-fay was abducted by her father, mourad moni samaan. an amber alert was issued friday for madeline, who was last seen a week ago in sacramento. in a written statement, the fbi in sacramento, california, said the bodies were found in samaan's vehicle saturday night but did not identify the bodies, saying more information would be released later. the green toyota 4runner was found in a remote area of el dorado county, near placerville, california, the fbi said. the amber alert system has been put in place so that we can hopefully locate and safely take people back into custody and put the child back, if that's the case, el dorado county sheriff's office spokesman lt. bryan golmitz told cnn affiliate kcra. when you end up with cases like this, it's tough. calls made sunday afternoon to the fbi and sheriff's office, inquiring about the identity of the two bodies were not immediately returned. in an earlier news release, the fbi described the father as a 49-year-old egyptian-born u.s. citizen. the federal agency called the circumstances of the abduction particularly concerning, adding that officials have reason to believe that the child's life may be in danger. the girl, madeline, has brown hair and brown eyes, weighs about 28 pounds and stands 2 feet, 8 inches tall, according to the amber alert. the fbi was working on the case along with members of the sacramento police department, the sacramento county sheriff, the california highway patrol and the california department of justice.

" attorney stephen braga, who represented echols, said his newly freed client and baldwin were fascinated by new foods, cell phones and other technology friday. it was if you could see two little 5-year-old kids at their first christmas, braga told cbs' early show saturday. the idea you could take pictures with an iphone totally blew them away. misskelley spent friday night with his family near west memphis. cnn affiliate wreg said echols, who met his wife while serving time, and baldwin left saturday for undisclosed locations to enjoy seclusion. echols and baldwin entered what is known as an alford plea on three counts of first-degree murder. misskelley entered similar pleas to one count of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder. craighead county circuit judge david laser sentenced the three to the 18 years already served and imposed a 10-year suspended sentence -- meaning they could be returned to jail if they violate the law. i don't think that it will make the pain go away to the victims' families. i don't think it will make the pain go away to the defendant families, laser said, adding it was nevertheless the best for all involved. critics of the case against the men argued that no direct evidence tied the three to the murders and that a knife recovered from a lake near the home of one of the men could not have caused the boys' wounds. more recent dna testing also demonstrated no links, according to the men's supporters. baldwin said he didn't initially want to accept the deal. this was not justice, he said, adding that he dropped his opposition to pave the way for echols' release from death row. i have now spent half my life on death row, echols said in a statement released saturday. it is a torturous environment that no human being should have to endure, and it needed to end. i am innocent, as are jason and jessie, but i made this decision because i did not want to spend another day of my life behind those bars. while prosecuting attorney scott ellington said the pleas entered friday validate the decision of jurors who sent the men to prison, it also spares arkansas the possibility of a retrial, which would have been difficult to prosecute after so many years, or a potential civil lawsuit by the men. the trio had been on course to win the right to new trials later this year. ellington said he believes the pleas resolve the case. i have no reason to believe there was anyone else involved in the homicide of these three children but the three defendants who pled guilty today, he said. but he said the state could file charges against others if new evidence emerges implicating someone else in the case. john mark byers, whose stepson christopher byers was one of the three victims, said he believes the three men are innocent and releasing them without exonerating them of the crime is an outrage. they're innocent. they did not kill my son, byers said before the hearing. the father of another of the victims, steven branch, also blasted the decision, but for another reason. i don't know what kind of deal they worked up, steve branch told cnn affiliate wmc-tv before the hearing. now you can get some movie stars and a little bit of money behind you, and you can walk free for killing somebody. baldwin, who said he prays for the victims' families, told wmc saturday he hopes to return to school. right now, i am floating on the hands of people who love and care for me, people trying to get my feet under me and everything, he said. i'm just trusting god to take care of me. braga credited new dna evidence, a new hearing and a new judge as instrumental to friday's proceedings. the attorney claims the three freed men and supporters will push to see that the real killer eventually is found. he's still out there, braga told cbs. the right guys have been set free.

" (cnn) -- a man who went snorkeling with missing u.s. woman robyn gardner in aruba shortly before she vanished is the beneficiary of a $1.5 million accidental death insurance policy tied to gardner, a local official told cnn wednesday. gary giordano, 50, of gaithersburg, maryland, has told investigators that he went snorkeling with the gardner, 35, on august 2 and that she failed to return to shore with him. giordano and gardner flew to aruba on july 31. a local judge recently ordered that giordano could be held until august 31 in connection with gardner's disappearance.

" (cnn) -- the orange county, florida, sheriff's office spent $293,123.77 on detective work in the disappearance of 2-year-old caylee anthony in 2008, according to authorities, and it wants to be reimbursed. the sheriff's office is among three law agencies asking a county judge in orlando to order the girl's mother, casey, to pay their investigative costs. a court hearing on that request was set to take place thursday, but it was rescheduled to september 2, court spokeswoman karen levey said wednesday. anthony has been in seclusion since her july acquittal on murder charges in the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter and her subsequent release from jail. but in the same case, a florida jury convicted her on four misdemeanor counts of providing false information to law enforcement officers. prosecutors cite those misdemeanor convictions as the legal basis for their request that anthony pay for the police costs involved in her daughter's disappearance. caylee anthony's skeletonized remains were found in december 2008 in woods less than a mile from her grandparents' florida home. lt. paul zambouros of the orange county sheriff's office said the investigative costs of $293,123.77 are based largely on the criminal investigation division's work between july 15, 2008, and december 11, 2008. if other deputies' work were included, the reimbursement for cost of investigation would certainly be larger, zambouros said in an internal july 28 memo. prosecutors are also seeking reimbursement for the florida department of law enforcement's investigative expenses of $71,939.56 and the metropolitan bureau of investigation's expenses of $10,645.38, according to court records. anthony's attorney didn't return calls for a comment.

" los angeles (cnn) -- the scheduled arraignment of a california woman charged with murder for allegedly pushing her 7-month-old boy off the fourth story of a parking garage was delayed thursday, a district attorney's spokeswoman said. the arraignment for sonia hermosillo -- once planned for thursday -- has been pushed back to monday, said farrah emami, a spokeswoman for the orange county district attorney's office. authorities initially charged hermosillo, 31, of la habra, california, with attempted murder. but after the boy died wednesday, prosecutors upgraded it to one felony count of murder and one felony count of assault on a child with force likely to produce great bodily injury resulting in death. if convicted, hermosillo would face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in state prison, according to the district attorney's office. the incident occurred monday at a parking garage at the children's hospital of orange county. a witness saw the baby fall and called police. investigators interviewed several witnesses and reviewed a surveillance video from the garage. the image of a license plate on a 2000 chevy blazer seen leaving the garage shortly after the incident led police to hermosillo. authorities found an empty child seat in hermosillo's vehicle, according to a police statement. the baby had medical conditions that required regular treatment at the children's hospital, the district attorney's office said, and he wore a helmet for one of his medical conditions. hermosillo is accused of removing the victim's helmet and pushing her baby from the parking structure with the intention of murdering him with the four-story fall, the district attorney's office said. she then walked inside the hospital, validated her parking and left the scene, the office said. baby noe, as the district attorney's statement referred to the infant, was critically injured and died wednesday at the university of california-irvine medical center. the district attorney's statement said hermosillo has two other children. cnn's jillian ohlenschlaeger contributed to this report.

" baseball's lenny dykstra charged with indecent exposure by stella chan , , cnn lenny dykstra is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges on september 7 in los angeles. story highlights lenny dykstra charged thursday with two counts of indecent exposure charges accuse him of allegedly exposing himself to women solicited on craigslist the former mlb star is scheduled to be arraigned on september 7 los angeles (cnn) -- former major league baseball star lenny dykstra was charged thursday with two counts of indecent exposure for allegedly exposing himself to women he solicited on craigslist. the los angeles city attorney's office says the charges stem from multiple reports involving dykstra dating back to 2009. the charges accuse dykstra of placing ads on craigslist requesting a personal assistant or housekeeping services. the victims allege when they arrive, they were informed that the job also requires massage service and then he (dykstra) would disrobe and he would expose himself, said los angeles city attorney spokesman frank mateljan. dykstra, a three-time major league all-star outfielder who played for the new york mets and the philadelphia phillies, is scheduled to be arraigned on september 7 in los angeles.

" as the corrections department had previously said in a statement, officials are not releasing anthony's address or anything that might lead to the discovery of her location, said plessinger. this move is an effort to comply with a judge's order that anthony's whereabouts should remain confidential for her own safety. the court made a pretty strong statement, talking about how she's one of the most hated women in america, plessinger said. we want to make sure that she's treated like other offenders, in that if she violates these court orders, we will immediately notify the court. but we will put security measures in place. those measures include not inputting anthony's information into a public database, as is typically the case with offenders. in addition, her probation officer will not be identified by name. under the terms of her sentence, anthony must meet with her probation officer no later than the fifth day of each month. she can't change her residence or employment and, as plessinger said thursday, her probation officer would have to ok a travel permit if anthony wants to leave the county. her probation office is in orange county, unless she makes a request that is granted to move elsewhere in florida. none of anthony's attorneys was present when she met with the probation officer wednesday, the state spokeswoman said. in that meeting, the officer laid out for her, in detail, the conditions -- after which anthony indicated she understood those conditions, said plessinger. among other things, anthony's sentence requires her to pay the state of florida $20 per month toward the cost of supervision plus a 4% surcharge, unless the fees are waived. during the period covered by the sentence, she will not be allowed to drink excessively. she is also barred from any personal contact with the check-fraud victim for the duration of the probation period. orange county circuit judge stan strickland had earlier ordered anthony to serve a year of probation after her release in the charges involving her daughter, but a clerk misunderstood the judge and prepared an order that the judge later signed, instructing that anthony would serve the probation while in custody awaiting trial. the order was updated august 1 to add the words upon release. but anthony's lawyers contended that she couldn't be required to serve probation, arguing that she had already served it while in custody under a signed order from strickland. they also argued that serving the probation sentence now would violate constitutional protections against having to serve a sentence twice for the same offense. a florida appeals court affirmed earlier this week that anthony would have to serve the one-year probation sentence. she cannot, the court ruled, take advantage of an administrative error to avoid serving the sentence, which was first imposed in 2010. this backed up a ruling earlier this month by orange county chief judge belvin perry jr., who said strickland's verbal order was binding and ordered anthony to report for probation in florida on the bad-check charge by friday. the attorney general's office wrote that anthony upon her release (july 17), should have reported for probation -- something she did not do. in an emergency petition filed on wednesday with the same appeals court, anthony's defense team asked that the court overturn perry's order before the required date. they also asked the appellate court to strip perry of further jurisdiction in the case. cnn's samuel gardner iii contributed to this report.

" (cnn) -- casey anthony's white pontiac sunfire is a crushed slab in a florida junkyard nearly seven weeks after she was acquitted of murder in her 2-year-old daughter's death, according a person in a law office close to the case. an assistant in the office of mark lippman -- who represents george and cindy anthony, who owned the car before giving it to their daughter, casey -- said friday that the car was destroyed a day earlier. the assistant declined to be named. that the vehicle had been crushed was first reported and documented by florida tv station wofl. the car, and the odor emanating from its trunk, had been central to the prosecution's case in anthony's murder trial. on june 27, 2008, she abandoned the pontiac at an orlando business, saying it had run out of gas, according to testimony. it later was towed to a wrecker yard, where it remained until july 15 of that year, when george and cindy anthony got a letter from the yard and went to pick up the car. several witnesses, including a tow yard employee and george anthony, said there was a vile smell coming from car's trunk. the prosecution alleged -- and expert witnesses testified -- that the odor was that of human decomposition. they claimed casey anthony duct-taped her daughter's mouth and nose to suffocate her, and then put the body in the pontiac's trunk before disposing of it. but the defense rebutted these claims, with attorney jose baez blasting what he called the state's fantasy of forensics in his closing argument. defense attorneys maintained the child, caylee, drowned in the anthony's above-ground pool on june 16, and that casey anthony and her father, george anthony, panicked upon finding her there and covered up the death. george anthony denied that in his testimony. baez claimed a phantom stain in the trunk should have included more in the way of dna evidence. he said the state used junk science relating to the odor and stain in the pontiac's trunk to reach its conclusions. after anthony was cleared on the murder charge -- and convicted on four lesser counts of misleading law enforcement -- alternate juror russell huekler told hln that he had a difficult time accepting that caylee's body had been in the car trunk. in session's nancy leung contributed to this report.

" (cnn) -- it was the deathbed request from the mother of a longtime fugitive that finally led the fbi to william walter asher iii. for 36 years, asher had been on the run -- ever since he escaped from a prison camp in 1975 rather than serve time for a deadly robbery. but last week, federal agents caught up to him. he had changed his name, worked for a trucking company and lived with a woman who had no idea about his criminal past. after 36 years of looking over his shoulder william walter asher iii, now 66 years old, is finally back where he belongs -- in prison, the fbi trumpeted in a press statement released monday. for years, it seemed that the fbi would never nab asher. in 1966, he and three accomplices robbed a san francisco bar, shooting and then beating the bartender to death, authorities said. asher was 20 at the time. he fled to chicago, hiding out for a year before he was caught. he was tried, convicted and sentenced to life in prison. the file would have closed there. but eight years into his sentence, asher escaped from a prison in el dorado county, california -- aided by a female accomplice. the fbi tracked asher to the northern territories of canada. they learned he had assumed a different name, that he worked as a long haul trucker, that he had married and raised a family. he eventually separated from his wife, and she didn't know where he went next. interestingly enough, several years ago one of asher's daughters contacted the fbi for information on the location of her father, the fbi said. the trail grew cold until 2005. shortly before she died, asher's mother asked relatives to get in touch with her son. she asked various family members to assist her in using the 'secret' number to call 'billy,' the fbi said. agents had been tipped off about the conversation by a source. armed with that information, agents scoured phone records of people who they believed may have helped fulfill the mother's request. they found two phone calls made to a home in salida, california, to a man named garry donald webb. the calls had been made two days before the mother died. agents looked at webb's driver's license photo. it resembled an older, thinner asher. authorities placed the home under surveillance. they also kept a watch on a trucking business where he was said to work. on friday, agents saw asher leaving the home and confronted him. after some initial discussion asher admitted his true identity, the fbi said. he had been living with a woman for more than a decade. she was unaware of his fugitive status, the fbi said. asher was taken into custody and to a tracy, california, facility that processes inmates newly committed to state prison. cnn's scott thompson contributed to this report "
