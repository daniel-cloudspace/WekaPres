" it was a tricky path for lou bordisso, 57 . his job as a licensed therapist was to help people in their worst moments. he counseled feuding married couples, families in distress and criminal defendants who were found not guilty by reason of insanity in his forensic mental health work for contra costa county in california. he was also a bishop. by no means was he ready to slow down. but seven years ago, he started losing his way around office buildings. he'd forget where the conference room was located. he missed meeting friends because he couldn't find the exit from the macy's department store in san francisco. finally in may 2010 after spinal taps, neuropsychological testing, mris and other tests, the doctor told him he had early onset alzheimer's. he tried to compensate for the deficiencies in his memory by working harder and taking more notes. although he had testified in court and written reports to judges in his role evaluating defendants' mental health, he realized that the disease affected the quality of his work. i had been writing a lot of reports to the judge making considerable errors, bordisso said. it became evident with my co-workers, peers and supervisors. it was time to take some time off. the decision was mutual. but retiring from his full-time counseling job and his duties as bishop was devastating, he said. it's a sense of despair and grief, he said. i'm going through what's similar to when someone loses a loved one in life. i'm hopefully moving to the point of acceptance. he continues his counseling work, although he has drastically reduced the number of clients he sees. because his long-term memory is better than his short-term memory, bordisso moved back to his childhood home in sacramento, california. the move makes it easier for him navigate his neighborhood and home. i'm used to contributing as a responsible, accountable person, he said. there's nothing worse for me than not being able to give back. being on the receiving end of services is granting me a new perspective in life. i'm becoming more appreciative of what others are going through. my sense of empathy has increased as well.

" editor's note: freelance writer amanda enayati contributes regularly to cnnhealth.com. (cnn) -- most anyone you stop on the street knows something about post-traumatic stress disorder, also referred to as ptsd. but mention post-traumatic growth and you are more likely than not to be met with blank stares. post-traumatic growth -- the ability not only to bounce back from adversity but also to flourish -- is an ever-present theme in most of our epic tales and spiritual traditions. and science is finally catching up. researchers have discovered that the key to post-traumatic growth is resilience, and also that resilience is not just an advantage of a lucky few. a lot of people erroneously believe that if you didn't get a good scramble of genes, resilience is not going to be your thing, says dr. karen reivich, co-author of the resilience factor. but resilience is a set of skills that, with effort, anyone can develop. that's important because there is no magic pill here. how can i get this resilience training? was the question i was most asked last week when i wrote about comprehensive soldier fitness, the army initiative to help soldiers build resilience and deal with high levels of sustained stress . since reivich also happens to be the research associate and primary trainer at the penn resiliency project and the developer of the army's master resilience training course, i asked her to guide me through the basic steps to becoming more resilient. according to reivich, resilience is made up of six basic building blocks. become more optimistic optimism is believing that good things can happen and that you can effect positive change in your life and in the world. pessimists underestimate how much control they have. they tend to focus their mental energy on things they can't do anything about. they also often hold the belief that optimists have their heads in the sand. in reality, though, most optimists can accurately assess what's going on; they just choose to place their attention on where they have control and influence as well on positive aspects of situations. that takes effort, reivich says. for many of us, it's easier to navigate toward and get consumed by the negative. with some mindfulness, you can direct your attention toward positive aspects of situations and what you can control. this is not outside anyone's purview. it is a habit that can be developed. an exercise to help boost optimism involves paying closer attention to the good things you have received in life. basically, says reivich, science corroborating grandma's advice. like a gratitude journal? i flash an old oprah episode. we call it a 'hunk of good stuff' journal. people who make a habit of gratitude have better health, better sleep, better life satisfaction, less depression, less stress, all sorts of things. we have people write down three good things that happened that day and a couple of sentences about each, like what it meant to them and how they're going to get more of it the next day. increase mental agility mental agility is the ability to see situations fully, accurately and from multiple perspectives. the mentally agile are able to avoid thinking traps when something goes wrong. thinking traps limit your flexibility because each of them cause you to only see a small aspect of what's going on. two of the more common thinking traps are the me-me-me trap (the tendency to always blame yourself) or the them-them-them trap (always blaming others). the key here is to identify which thinking trap you fall into and to develop your ability to be more flexible and accurate in your understanding of adverse situations. once you become aware of the trap, you can hit the pause button and repeat a catchphrase to help you get a more accurate and flexible grasp of the situation. the catchphrase for the me me me trap, for example, is look outward. seek self-awareness self-awareness helps you understand your habits of thinking, feeling and acting so you can ask yourself, how's that working for you? it involves listening to your interpretation of adverse circumstances to figure out your internal dialogue under stress. when something triggers you -- an activating event as little as not getting a parking spot or as big as losing a loved one -- where does your mind go? we teach people to look for patterns. does your brain start sending out themes like 'loss,' 'danger' or 'trespass'? these patterns are like the glasses that color the way you see all events in your life -- good and bad. one simple way to exercise self-awareness is to keep a journal of your thoughts and beliefs during stressful periods. what was the first thing that popped into your mind when something happened? and what was that about? reivich asks. self-regulate self-regulation involves learning how to reverse counterproductive thinking by having more appropriate reactions. the less resilient often catastrophize when something happens. we call it making a himalaya out of a mountain, reivich says. it's something, but you make it bigger. the downward spiral of negative catastrophic thinking makes you feel out of control. the problem then becomes a runaway train and creates huge anxiety. and that blocks purposeful action. reivich suggests an exercise called putting it in perspective, which may at first seem counterintuitive. the exercise involves creating three columns. first, record all catastrophic thoughts under the worst-case scenario column. next, write down the wildly unlikely, best-case scenarios. and finally, list the most likely outcomes. reivich finds that this exercise helps people assess things they are going to have to confront and often leads to quite dramatic shifts in their emotions as well as the ability to tackle what's in front of them. and it takes a total of seven minutes. focus on strengths this aspect of resilience involves identifying your top character strengths. that might be your bravery, wisdom, sense of humor or the ability to love and be loved, reivich observes. people can usually tell you what their strengths are and who they are at their best. those who tend to stay more resilient in the face of adversity are using these strengths to overcome. they feel energized, motivated and true to themselves. (readers can take penn's via survey of character strengths test (and a number of other related tests) by registering for free at http://www.authentichappiness.com/ develop better connections the myth about resilience is that it's a solitary sport. but the key message here is that relying on others is necessary and it is certainly not a sign of weakness. we teach people techniques that help build positive relationships, such as dr. shelly gable's active and constructive responding technique . most of us believe that the quality of our relationship is determined by the answer to the question, will you be there for me when things go wrong? but the real question is, will you be there for me when things go right? research shows that people respond in four typical ways to good news, and only one of those ways strengthens our relationships; the others erode relationships over time: (1) the conversation killer ( that's great! as you're texting or on the computer); (2) the conversation hijacker ( that reminds me of my good news! ); (3) the joy thief ( but what about ...? and going on to list the downsides); and (4) the joy multiplier (involves constructive responding -- that is, asking questions, offering praise, favoring the positive experience, being authentically interested in the details). the beauty is that multiplying joy is not hard to do. it just requires intention and attention. at the end of the day, reivich says, none of this stuff we're teaching is wildly difficult. they're basic, tried-and-true principles. but they do require practice. we live in a culture that is so quick-fix oriented, so if something doesn't lead to dramatic and huge change overnight we give up. these things take persistence and effort.

" (cnn) -- if you're a woman contemplating surgery on your female parts, you'll find plenty of ladies chatting and blogging away about their experiences, often on websites adorned with pink ribbons. but if you're a man considering male surgery there's not so much out there. there's no ribbon for, say, penis surgery, and comparatively few men trading stories and sharing advice. women are much more engaged with their health, says dr. dennis pessis, president-elect of the american urological association. it's gotten better in the past 15 years, but still, men don't always seek out the best treatments for themselves. penis surgery has been in the spotlight this week as a civil trial in kentucky made national headlines. phillip seaton, a kentucky truck driver, sued his urologist, dr. john patterson, saying he went in for a circumcision but left the surgery with part of his penis amputated. patterson says seaton had cancer and needed the amputation or he would have died. the doctor won the case on wednesday, according to cnn affiliate wdrb . seaton's experience is certainly rare, surgery on the penis isn't. while good statistics are hard to find, tens of thousands of men in the united states get circumcised as adults. other common surgeries include implants for men suffering erectile dysfunction and removal of genital warts. here's the empowered patient list of questions every man should ask before having these procedures on this most valued and delicate of organs. 1. do i really need this procedure? think twice (or more) before having the surgery. it's a highly vascularized organ, which is a fancy way of saying there is a lot of blood running in and out of it, so cutting into it can be risky. men getting circumcised as adults should consider the risk of bleeding, especially if they're on a blood thinner, including aspirin. getting implants requires cutting, too, and doctors urge men with erectile dysfunction to try other, less risky, treatments first, such as drugs like viagra, penile injections, or a penis pump, an external device that fits over the organ. you'll also need to choose what kind of anesthesia you'll want for your circumcision. you can opt for a local anesthetic and a sedative -- you'll be (or should be) relaxed but awake. men who are especially anxious about the surgery often opt for general anesthesia, which is slightly more risky but ensures they'll be totally out for the procedure. as for genital warts, if a man is not experiencing problems such as itching, burning or pain, he may not need treatment, according to the mayo clinic. 2. what are my treatment options? there is more than one type of penile implant and there is more than one way to remove genital warts. doctors tend to specialize in one method over the other, so make sure your doctor lays out all the options and refers you to another doctor who can perform the procedure the way you prefer. there are two types of implants. with inflatable implants, doctors put cylinders inside the penis, a pump in the scrotum, and a fluid reserve inside either the scrotum or the abdominal wall. before sex, you pump the fluid into the cylinders to create an erection. after sex, you activate a release valve in the scrotum to let the fluid out. the second type of implant involves putting semi-rigid rods into the penis, and it is bent away from the body to have sex (think of it as a goose-necked desk lamp that can be pointed in various directions). for more on various types of penile implants, see information from the mayo clinic and the american urological association. for warts, you can treat them yourself or your doctor can treat them. if you choose the diy approach, your doctor prescribes a medicine for you to apply at home. if you prefer to have your doctor treat the warts, there are several options: your doctor can apply a medicine, which is sometimes a stronger version of what you can apply at home. there is also an option to cauterize or laser the warts, or to freeze them off with liquid nitrogen. you should give yourself some time to make the right decision, says dr. gopal badlani, a urologist at wake forest baptist medical center. you don't want to decide at the first appointment. for more information on the various options for removing genital warts, see information from the centers for disease control and prevention. 3. doctor, how many of these procedures have you done? look for a urologist who regularly performs the procedure you need. some urologists do nothing but treat kidney stones or urinary incontinence, and you don't want that urologist doing your circumcision, says dr. irwin goldstein, director of san diego sexual medicine. they need to know what they're doing so they don't remove too much or too little skin, or create a new problem like an angled penis. while there's no magic number, goldstein says if you're having a circumcision, find someone who does at least two or three a month. plus, you should ask the doctor for names of his or her previous circumcision patients. it's sort of like fixing your roof -- you want to talk to a client who's used that roofer, he advises. ask about the doctor's follow-up: was he available, or did he just do the surgery and you didn't hear from him again? for implants, also try to find a doctor who does at least two or three a month, goldstein advises, not someone who just dabbles in the procedure. we did three implants monday, just to give you a sense of how often some doctors do these, goldstein adds. the removal of genital warts isn't as complicated as circumcision or implant surgery, but still make sure it's something your doctor does regularly. 4. will the treatment really cure my problem? badlani says no matter how much he counsels his patients before implant surgery, most are disappointed the implants didn't give them as large an erection as they had when they were 18. ninety-five percent of the time, after the surgery the patient feels shortchanged. they say, 'doc, i expected it to be much longer,' badlani says. men need to have more realistic expectations. men are also sometimes surprised that their genital warts come back after treatment. but the mayo clinic says genital warts are likely to recur because even after you remove them, you still carry the virus that causes warts, called the human papillomavirus (hpv). 5. should i clean up before the surgery? cutting into the penis leaves you vulnerable to infection, so ask your doctor if you should be scrubbing at home before surgery day. goldstein tells his circumcision patients to clean with a special antiseptic once a day for three days before the surgery. he has his implant patients wash up morning and night for seven days before surgery, and take antibiotics for three days before. we're inserting a foreign body into the penis. the chances for things to go wrong are magnified, so we want to take all precautions, he says. cnn's sabriya rice contributed to this report.

" jobs said in january 2009 that doctors said he dropped so much weight because of a hormone imbalance that has been 'robbing' me of the proteins my body needs to be healthy. sophisticated blood tests have confirmed this diagnosis. the former ceo never disclosed any more details; doctors unaffiliated with his care said a variety of conditions could have caused the weight loss, including cancer and diabetes. if related to his a recurrence of his cancer, a pancreatic tumor would typically lead to an overproduction of hormones including glucagon, which results in weight loss if produced in excess, dr. jeffrey mechanick said in 2009. mechanick, a clinical professor at mount sinai medical center in new york, was not involved in jobs' care. that same year, jobs underwent a liver transplant in tennessee. dr. james d. eason of methodist university hospital transplant institute announced in june 2009 that mr. jobs is now recovering well and has an excellent prognosis. the odds are against the pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cancer patient who has a liver transplant, but close to half of the patients may be free of cancer four to five years after the transplantation, said dr. simon lo, director of the pancreatic and biliary diseases program at cedars-sinai medical center in los angeles, who did not treat jobs. still, relatively few liver transplants have been performed as a treatment for neuroendocrine tumors, making it a somewhat experimental option, devoe said. if the patient has a lot of disease in the liver, it can extend life, but there's no guarantee that this will remove all of the cancer remaining in the body. and immunosupression drugs required after a liver transplant could allow any remaining cancer to grow faster, devoe said. in rare cases, immune suppression itself can also cause cancer, said dr. james yao, oncologist at the university of texas m.d. anderson cancer center in houston, who has not treated jobs. on the bright side, there are two new cancer drugs that have been approved this year that may apply to someone in jobs' situation, experts say. everolimus is available to treat pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and prevents transplant rejection. but there are serious potential side effects, which may include lung or breathing problems, infections and renal failure, which may lead to death. sunitinib malate is prescribed for the treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, kidney cancer and gist, a rare cancer of the bowel, esophagus or stomach. this too carries its risks; it can cause liver problems and death. the good news that this is an area where there are a lot of advances, yao said.

" still, he was trying to do everything right. he was on a statin medicine, which he said had lowered his cholesterol from just under 300 to 125. total cholesterol of 240 or above is considered a risk factor for heart disease. also, bare's typical diet was better than most: oatmeal for breakfast, fruit for lunch, chicken or mexican food for dinner. he didn't smoke. he was not overweight or diabetic. friends are saying if there's anybody in the group that shouldn't be going through this, it would be me, because of my lifestyle, bare said. but, he added, my brother has gone through this. my mom has gone through this. i knew it was coming. dr. dean ornish, who has researched the relationship between lifestyle and health, says even the most malignant family history can be overcome. i don't think anyone is doomed to have heart disease, said ornish, founder and president of the preventive medicine research institute . you know, even if your mother and your father and your sister and your brother all die from heart disease it doesn't mean you need ever to die from it, he added. it just means you need to make bigger changes in your life than someone else who doesn't have those kinds of genes. for someone like bare, that might mean adopting a plant-based diet, ornish said. heart attack-proof diet? red flag bare was worried enough about his heart health that he underwent a coronary calcium scan four years ago. the test showed plaque building up in his coronary arteries. my score was 111, bare said. zero is the best score. five is the average score for someone his age. a score over 100 meant an elevated risk of heart attack. he had another coronary calcium scan this year. his score was up to 243. a survey by the american heart association suggests many are misguided about their heart health. some 39% of americans think their heart health is ideal. the actual number is less than 1%, said nancy brown, ceo of the heart association. will you have a heart attack? tests that can tell we're very concerned because we're seeing the risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease increasing, brown said. future bare has returned to school part-time until he regains his strength and he's hoping bypass surgery has given him a new lease on life. the science teacher says he'd like to travel, maybe see a volcano erupt. i'm told that i'm good for another 40 years or so, and i'm hoping that's the case, but with my history, i'm going to have to watch it, bare said. even so, bare said he has no plans to give up the food he loves.
