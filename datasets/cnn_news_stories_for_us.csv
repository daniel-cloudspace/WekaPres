" by far, the worst flash-mob violence has occurred over the past few weeks in the united kingdom. angry hordes terrorized neighborhoods in london, birmingham and elsewhere. buildings were torched. people were beaten. homes were vandalized and looted. british authorities said the rioters communicated their intent for destruction through blackberry messenger, a private mobile-messaging system that's popular with young people in the uk. one reported text read: if you're down for making money, we're about to go hard in east london. police playing catch-up at least one expert believes most members of law enforcement are far behind the times when it comes to battling flash robs. part of the challenge is generational. older officers in management positions -- the ones making decisions -- are often not as savvy as younger officers with social media, said nancy kolb, who oversees the international association of chiefs of police's center for social media . it's important to empower your younger officers, or those with expertise, to teach everyone else. many authorities said they believed for years that flash mobs were not a threat. the impression among officers was that flash mobs were harmless groups of strangers responding to a text or e-mail inviting them to gather to perform a cute choreographed dance routine in a public place, kolb said. witness the recent at t commercial about an ill-timed flash-mob dancer in new york's grand central terminal. in october, the police executives group sent a survey to 728 law enforcement agencies in 48 states asking if flash mobs were a problem in their community. eighty-one percent of respondents said no. more than 70% of responding agencies also said they had not identified any goals for officers' use of social-media tools such as facebook and twitter, even though the vast majority of law enforcement officers were using them. sixty-six percent of respondents said they had received no training in how to use social media. when the group's center for social media opened about a year and a half ago with justice department funds, flash mobs had only begun to show a dark side. today, investigators are asking themselves: why did flash mobs seem to go suddenly from fun to frightening? jeff gardere, a california psychologist who lectures widely on the motivations of young people, said he's not surprised by the shift. we're at a point where everyone understands the power of a flash mob, he said. people inevitably started thinking this was accessible to them, and of course it is -- everyone has a phone. gardere said he believes that part of the reason flash mobs have gotten violent is that young people are discontent and bored. they don't have jobs. they hear their parents talking about the lack of jobs. they feel their options are winnowing every day. this isn't just in england or philly or germantown but everywhere, gardere said. you've got a group that feels angry and powerless, and they're trying to assume a sense of power. a curfew in philadelphia until recently, most law enforcement officials assumed flash mobs only happened in large cities. it was philadelphia who had the problem -- that seemed to be the thinking, kolb said. since the spring of 2010, police have reported a series of violent flash-mob incidents in central philadelphia. in one episode last year, a crowd of some 200 lawbreakers, mostly teenagers, roamed the streets robbing bystanders and breaking windows. authorities suspect the group gathered after seeing a call on facebook or twitter to meet up. last month another flash mob of about 30 teens allegedly beat two apparent bystanders near philadelphia city hall, knocking one unconscious and breaking another person's jaw. that incident came just weeks after a gang of youths, who philadelphia authorities say were stoked by a call on social media, attacked diners leaving restaurants and robbed train passengers. other flash robbers swarmed stores, grabbed what they liked and walked out. the violence prompted mayor michael nutter and police to enforce a citywide curfew mandating that anyone under 18 be indoors by midnight. parents of violators would be fined $500, they warned. law enforcement experts believe that has been the most significant step to date in calming flash mobs . philadelphia police investigators also have been friending younger philadelphians on facebook in the hopes of monitoring chatter about potential mayhem. the curfew idea was a great one, but temporary. the facebook idea is where we need to go, said los angeles county sheriff's capt. mike parker, a leading expert on how law enforcement should use social media to fight crime. name the social-networking site, and parker has used it to help track down a criminal or do a background check. the skill he most often teaches other officers is how to recognize a facebook posting or a twitter hashtag that suggests flash-mob planning is under way. 'flash calling' and the game parker is helping lead the los angeles county sheriff's department investigation of hip-hop artist the game, who sent a twitter message last week that contained the phone number to a sheriff's station. hundreds of the rapper's 580,000 twitter followers overwhelmed dispatchers with calls, effectively preventing the public access to emergency help. the game apologized for his tweet on cnn on wednesday. it's unclear if he will be charged. that raises another question for law enforcement -- how should a person who encourages mayhem in a tweet be treated by the justice system? ucla law professor eugene volokh said he believes they should be prosecuted the same way as someone who incites violence in person. we don't need to create a new set of laws for an old set of problems, volokh told cnn. but parker said police don't have a solution yet on how to stop flash calling. just when we thought flash mobs were a problem, we have this to deal with, the sheriff's captain said. but that's technology. there's always going to be something (new). authorities fight back online many law enforcement agencies across the country are financially strapped and understaffed. in los angeles county, the sheriff's department has lost 500 officers recently to budget cuts, parker said. parker recommends that local agencies pool staff and budgets to train officers on social-media tools. he also suggests they set up websites for posting video -- such as surveillance-camera footage of a suspect -- that authorities want the public to see, promoted through the department's twitter and facebook accounts. this is so basic, but if you know there's going to be a dance, you have to get on the invite list, parker says. you have to be on these sites -- facebook, twitter, foursquare, flickr -- with the mindset that you're not just watching passively. you're engaging. parker urges fellow officers to network with citizens on facebook and twitter as a way of monitoring chatter and increasing cooperation with police. make yourself a friend, approachable. you have to position yourself in a way that isn't threatening, because we really are not there to shut down anyone's fun, he said. parker said the online chatter about flash mobs is often full of boasting. would-be flash mobbers usually assume the police are the enemy, he said, so they amp themselves up for a fight. if you see that, try to get involved in the discussion and dispel it, he said. it's all basic communication. let me try to understand you, and you try to understand where i'm coming from. police in maryland acted quickly and creatively after the 7-eleven robbery. within hours, investigators posted surveillance camera footage on youtube and blasted out that link on local media. detectives then headed to a local high school, where they asked the principal and students to help them identify faces. within a day, they had identified at least half of the alleged thieves, said smith, the police spokeswoman. no arrests had been made as of thursday morning. but we feel confident, smith said. technology and old-fashioned police work are on our side.

" judge: indiana teens' racy social media photos are protected speech by ali elkin, cnn story highlights teenagers posed with phallic-shaped rainbow lollipops and posted the photos online parent brought print-outs of the photos to the superintendent school suspended girls from sports, sent them to counseling, asked them to apologize indiana district judge found the school had violated the students' first amendment rights (cnn) -- an indiana school district might appeal a summary judgment that said it violated two students' first amendment rights by punishing them for posting racy photos to social networking sites, the district's lawyer said. the female students, then both rising sophomores, took a series of photos featuring phallic-shaped rainbow lollipops at several sleepovers during summer 2009. none of the photos were openly accessible to non-friends or those who did not have a photo-sharing password. the pictures got into school officials' hands after a parent printed them and complained to the district's superintendent that they had caused divisiveness on the plaintiffs' volleyball team. the opinion , which district judge philip simon issued on august 10, said the smith-green school district in churubusco, indiana, did not have the right to temporarily bar the two students from extracurricular activities, require them to go to counseling and apologize to the district's all-male coaches board. the opinion does not identify the students, as they are both minors. regardless they are the butt of several jokes throughout simon's 38-page explanation of his decision. let's be honest about it: the speech in this case doesn't exactly call to mind high-minded civic discourse about current events, simon writes. churubusco high school's code of conduct says activities in or out of school that could dishonor the school are punishable, but the opinion questions the policy's constitutionality. erik weber, general counsel for smith-green schools, said the district does not see the code as being unconstitutional. there's a judgment that's been rendered by the court. it's respected because it's rendered by a judge, but it doesn't mean that the school is going to agree with that and settle the litigation at this point, weber said. it's an unsettled area of the law, and i don't think this is going to be the final say on how social media and the school environment intertwine. a decision on a portion of the school's defense is still pending, weber said. another indiana district recently won a case that granted it immunity from paying damages under the 11th amendment, which grants such immunity to states. that district is defending the decision in an appellate court. weber said the smith-green district will wait on that case's outcome, and consequently the decision for its own case, before deciding whether or not to appeal. the american civil liberties union is representing the students. ken falk, legal director of the aclu's indiana chapter, said just because schools have access to information about students' behavior outside school does not mean they have the authority to discipline that behavior. what schools have to recognize is there is that line and the type of stuff that my friends and i in high school did -- i'm in my late 50s now -- the school never knew about, falk said. now, of course, with social media, the school and school personnel can easily find out. but that doesn't change the calculus. simon's opinion disagreed with the district's arguments that the photos should not be considered protected speech. the ruling says they do not count as obscene or child pornography because they contain no nudity and had a high probability of being understood as humorous by their intended teenage audience. additionally, the court opinion holds the situation up against landmark supreme court speech-in-school cases, applying them with the added variable of social media. one of the major issues in the case was whether the girls' pictures qualify as a substantial disruption to school operations, which would then not be protected speech. simon's opinion said the photo shoots, conducted off school property without portraying any school insignia and not shared with the wider school community, were not such a disruption. a student cannot be punished with a ban from extracurricular activities for nondisruptive speech, the opinion says. as schools and courts grapple with determining where a school's authority ends online, more first amendment cases like this one will crop up, said catherine ross, a professor at the george washington university law school and author of the forthcoming the troubled first amendment in our public schools. traditionally, one could talk about a kind of geographical analogy with speech in schools, ross said. it was fairly clear what speech took place in school and what speech took place out of school. new tests are starting to emerge to determine whether online speech takes place in school, such as determining whether the person who created the speech made it available at school. without such distinctions, the school would become almost a police state that could reach out and discipline students for what they do anywhere, ross said. if we are going to delegate decision-making authority to school officials, as we have to, since i don't think we want the courts running the schools, then we have to hold them to a high standard, she said. ross said there are some very clear-cut examples of online behavior that constitute disturbances in school. cyberbullying, for example, interferes with a student's education. though ross said she agreed with simon's opinion, she said the digs and jokes that pervade the document should not belittle the importance of the students' decision to pursue the case. these two girls and their families stood up for first amendment rights, ross said. and while the judge makes a few comments at their expense, the only way we preserve rights is when people are willing to fight for them. so whatever misjudgment these girls showed in their so-called bad behavior, for society this is very productive litigation, because it protects the rights of other students, as well.

" yosemite national park, california (cnn) -- a 17th person has died in yosemite national park, which has been experiencing a higher than usual number of fatalities this year, authorities said. authorities have identified a man who fell monday evening off half dome, the park's renowned soaring granite formation in the sierra nevada, park officials said wednesday. the person, whose body was recovered tuesday at the base of half dome by rangers, was identified as ryan leeder, 23, of los gatos, california, park officials said. the incident appears to be accidental and remains under investigation, park spokesmen said wednesday. the 17 deaths are about twice the usual rate at yosemite, officials said. authorities are searching for answers to explain the recent rash of deaths at the national park in california. in july, near yosemite's beautiful mist trail, a young man lost his footing, slipping close to the edge of a waterfall. a female companion frantically grabbed for him but stumbled. another hiker followed and the three were swept over the powerful 317-foot vernal fall. authorities at yosemite national park are still searching for two of the bodies. that month was the busiest july for the park since 1985, with 730,487 visitors, park officials said. last year, the park recorded 4,047,880 visitors, according to a statistical chart provided by park spokesmen. while five visitors have died this year from natural causes, the others were accidental and often preventable, officials said. rangers say some visitors partake in dangerous practices such as hiking treacherous trails in flip-flops, climbing over safety rails to take better pictures or swimming perilously close to waterfalls. witnesses told park authorities that the three hikers who were swept over the waterfall in july had climbed over a safety rail. we don't station a ranger in every possible dangerous place that's out there, said kari cobb, a park ranger. people have to come here and realize that yosemite is nature, and it is a very wild place. bill ott, a hiker, said he has seen people swimming in dangerous waters. we saw a number of people wading just steps from going into the faster water. it's crazy. just crazy, he said. visitor tim timmerman said he has a plan to keep his family safe. we aren't worried because we think if you stay where you're supposed to stay, you're safe and it's exciting, timmerman said. it'll be a little scary for them, but it's not dangerous if you do what you're supposed to do. cnn's casey wian reported from yosemite national park.

" read more about this story from cnn affiliate kyw . (cnn) -- the owner of a south philadelphia cheesesteak shop who once instructed customers to order only in english has died, according to relatives. joey vento had a heart attack at home and died tuesday on the way to the hospital, said joseph perno, his nephew and manager of the shop. things are a little somber tonight, perno told cnn affiliate kyw behind the grill at geno's. but he's in our hearts. vento founded geno's in 1966 in philadelphia, where it sits across the street from another cheesesteak shop, pat's king of steaks. pat's claims to have invented the cheesesteak in 1933, but both stores welcome a plethora of visitors to the city of brotherly love each year, and serve the popular steak sandwiches 24 hours a day, seven days a week. for more than 40 years, the rivals have been engaged in a friendly competition over who makes the city's best cheesesteak. geno's became a popular stop for presidential candidates on the campaign trail and a photo gallery on the restaurant's website shows employees posing with celebrities such as oprah, shaquille o'neal and ray romano. vento made national headlines in 2006 when he posted a sign on one of his restaurant's windows that read, this is america. when ordering, please speak english. the sign prompted the philadelphia commission on human relations to file a discrimination suit. vento said he was using common sense by expecting americans to speak english at his establishment, and refused to take down the sign. two years after the controversy began, the suit was overturned. since his death, fans are using twitter and facebook to leave messages. joey vento was a true american patriot, one message read. others paid tribute to his famed sandwiches. thank you for making the world just a little bit better by being here. now heaven will have the best cheesesteaks in the world!! rip joey "
" arizona sues over key provision of civil rights act by bill mears , cnn supreme court producer story highlights the law requires that local voting changes be cleared by the justice department the state alleges random enforcement based on the whim of federal authorities u.s. attorney general eric holder vows to defend the law in court a 2009 supreme court ruling opened the door to challenges to the preclearance provision (cnn) -- arizona has become the latest jurisdiction to challenge continuing federal oversight over a key provision of the landmark civil rights act of 1965. officials in phoenix filed a lawsuit in federal court thursday, saying requirements to preclear all local voting changes with the u.s. justice department are unconstitutional. it follows a supreme court ruling two years ago that gave states and local communities more power to appeal the preclearance provision of the law. that section provides continuing federal control over election practices in 16 states, based on past discrimination against minority voters. other states are not covered by the provision even if they, too, might discriminate against minority voters. the conservative high court majority ruled the justice department was applying the powerful enforcement tool too broadly. arizona attorney general tom horne said washington punishes states with random enforcement based on the whim of federal authorities. arizona has been subjected to enforcement actions for problems that were either corrected nearly 40 years ago and have not been repeated, or penalized for alleged violations that have no basis in the constitution, horne said. that needs to stop. at issue is whether congress in 2006 properly extended the civil rights law -- whose section 5 mandates that the covered states get advance approval of changes in how their elections are conducted -- or whether the country has made enough progress on racial equality to make continued federal oversight essentially unnecessary. the high court concluded in its narrow ruling that sufficient progress had been made. under the law, things have changed in the south. voter turnout and registration rates now approach parity, wrote chief justice john roberts. past success alone, however, is not adequate justification to retain the preclearance requirements. the act imposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs. but while opening the door for challenges to the law, the court upheld the federal government's enforcement power. and it refused to resolve the larger constitutional questions of when race-based solutions can be used to remedy past and present voter discrimination. with this legal challenge from arizona, the conservative majority may be poised to tackle the issue in coming years. but first, a federal judge will handle the state's lawsuit. no trial has yet been scheduled. attorney general eric holder vowed to defend the law in court. the voting rights act plays a vital role in our society by ensuring that every american has the right to vote and to have that vote counted, holder said in a prepared statement. the department of justice will vigorously defend the constitutionality of the voting rights act in this case, as it has done successfully in the past. the provisions challenged in this case, including the preclearance requirement, were reauthorized by congress in 2006 with overwhelming and bipartisan support. the 2009 high court case involved a small homeowners association board outside austin, texas. residents of the canyon creek planned community eight years ago sought to move its federal-election polling place to an elementary school that is the neighborhood's polling place for all other elections. such a move required federal approval under section 5, which was eventually granted. backed by a group of conservative activists, residents launched a direct challenge to the law's preclearance provision, arguing it should not be enforced in areas where it can be argued racial discrimination no longer exists. the high court's ruling made the texas district eligible to bail out, or become exempt from future federal oversight. civil rights groups say section 5 has proven an important tool to protect minority voters from local governments that could set unfair or unconstitutional barriers to the polls. if it were to be ruled unconstitutional someday, they argue, the very power and effect of the entire voting rights act would crumble. since 1982, only 17 jurisdictions have been able to bail out or become exempt from federal oversight, out of about 12,000 covered political jurisdictions. arizona has also challenged washington's authority to enforce immigration laws. a state measure known as sb 1070 would, among other things, give local law enforcement agencies the power to apprehend and help deport illegal immigrants. the obama administration say immigration is the exclusive role of the federal government. the civil rights case is state of arizona v. holder.

" steve largent of the industry's wireless association said that it was comparable to a flood of cars causing a traffic jam at rush hour. a huge number of users were trying to use the same highway at the same time, which caused the jam, he said. he argued that one solution would be to apportion more bandwidth to the wireless industry. with more spectrum, we'd have more lanes that would allow more users, he said. but university of maryland engineering professor ashok agrawala said that solving the problem was not that simple. whichever system you design has a finite capacity, he said. moreover, he said, if they built a capacity which can handle the peak load that we had at the time of the earthquake, most of the time, most of that system will remain idle. and that will be expensive, he said, making everyone's phone bills go up. still, why don't 911 calls get priority over all other cell phone calls? there should be some way to prioritize it for emergency calls, said fcc's barnett. technology is on the way, called lte, that would allow it to go to the top of the cue. he said the fcc is asking the major cell carriers to consult with them on implementing it. with hurricane irene bearing down on the east coast, just days after that earthquake, residents might wonder whether the same problem will strike again. since a storm does not strike at a single instant, a sudden overload of calls is less likely. but if cell phone towers are affected, wireless callers could again face trouble getting through. officials and phone companies suggest that customers who can't get a connection should try texting instead. on tuesday, @fema tweeted this: reminder: if cell phone service is busy, text or e-mail friends/family to let them know you're ok. how can text messages get through, even when phone calls can't? a live, two-minute phone call takes a full two minutes to transmit -- it can't be shortened, and it can't be time-shifted. but a 100-character text can be transmitted in a fraction of a second, and can be put in a cue to be transmitted whenever a free route is identified. sprint spokeswoman crystal davis said, we could get roughly 30-50 text messages (if not more) sent in the same period of time a call would take place.

" on north carolina's ocracoke, there is only one way off the island -- by ferry. the county ordered tourists and residents to evacuate. bobby hill, the emergency manager for the north carolina ferry division, said more than 1,500 people left wednesday. the ferries are operating all day thursday, he said, but the last chance for anyone to get off the isolated, skinny island sticking out in the atlantic, is one boat friday morning. after that, well, you are out of options. clayton gaskill was one of about 100 ocracoke residents still around thursday night. in between playing progressive rock songs on community radio wovv-fm, he talked about residents making final preparations. you pick up stuff that will float. this is a little more serious than many of them, gaskill said, referring to other storms in the region. isabel in 2003 and alex in 2004 did have significant impact. residents have a couple grocery stores, ice and an emergency electrical source to help them ride out and recover from irene. as long as the storm is in progress, you are on your own, gaskill said. hill has lived through 15 hurricanes in his lifetime: floyd, hazel, connie, david. he's used to boarding up his home in coastal beaufort and firing up the generator. you might call him a veteran. you're a veteran of one and they still keep coming, he said. irene? well, it will be another name on the long list. janeen wall has only one name in her hurricane memory. floyd in 1999. it was scary, she said. so much so that wall was not taking any chances. she arrived at her rented vacation condo on carolina beach just this monday. but by thursday, she was safely back home in richmond, virginia, buying extra bottles of water and gas for the grill, in case the power goes out. in wilmington, north carolina, leigh muscle planned a dream wedding for saturday -- along the intracoastal waterway, of course. literally my first reaction was, 'nooo!,' muscle told cnn affiliate wway. she had planned to walk down the aisle in the front yard of her mother's house; the reception was to be in the back yard, along the water. as of now, it looks like it's just going to be a little bit of rain and a little bit of wind, and it just looks like we need to move the event from outside to inside, so that's what we're planning, muscle said. she's hoping a perfect storm won't ruin her perfect day. on nags head, leanne and nathan robinson, surfers since they were kids, hoped to ride a few waves like they do in every hurricane the north carolina natives have lived through. the winds are too high during the hit, but the swell before and after the storm could be ideal. but this time, it's different. not because irene is so huge, or that she is eyeing the outer banks. but this time, the young couple owns a house. this time, they have a 2-year-old daughter to protect. if it looks like a direct hit, leanne plans to evacuate with their child. nathan will stay to look after the house and the surf shop that leanne manages. we are going to wait until tomorrow afternoon to make a decision, leanne robinson said. in the meantime, they've brought in the tomato plants, picked up debris and tied down everything that needs to be secured. and they cut dead branches off the tall pines in their yard. farther north in lewes, delaware, georgia tugend is planning to ride out the storm along with her husband, dave, and dog, barkley. our plan is not to leave, tugend said. temporary shelters will not take the dog, and we feel that our house is elevated enough that we would avoid any possible storm surge. tugend, who lives about half a mile from the delaware bay, said she and her husband are securing several items in their yard, including outdoor furniture and a 14-foot aluminum boat. we're going to hope for the best as far as the cars go, she said, noting that they don't have a garage. tugend said she plans to fill her tub with water, and may stock up on extra beer as well. we had some really bad storms this past fall and winter with gusts clocked up to 70 miles per hour. we know we can get through that, she said. but you don't want to get cocky. if we get 100-mile per hour winds, that's a different ballgame. we've never lived through that. in nearby dewey beach, 71-year-old allan lynch was taking steps to protect his restaurant, the captain's table. lynch, a lifelong resident of the area, is planning to cover all of the windows at the restaurant, take down loose signs outside and bring in his trash cans. lynch said he will probably close his business. he's also bringing in a supply of dry ice to help preserve the restaurant's food in case power is lost. as for himself, lynch said he would probably go inland a little bit and seek shelter with his 90-year-old mother if the storm becomes severe enough. lynch's wife stocked up extra milk, water and batteries. some described their preparations as minimal, such as nathan nickerson in cape cod, massachusetts. but i've got my chainsaw sharpened, and i've got my tractor ready to clear the way if there are a lot of downed trees, he said. nickerson predicted that traffic at his business -- arnold's lobster and clam bar in eastham -- will probably drop off to nothing, at least temporarily. but the place will stay open as long as it can, nickerson said. thursday, he was already taking down several awnings, tents, and umbrellas. if nothing else, he joked, he would hold arnold's annual employee party during the storm. meanwhile, the owner of alex's bait tackle at point pleasant beach in new jersey said he's preparing for the worst. he's going to put as many as 150 sandbags in front of his water's edge store. i will stay here as long as i can, marc palazzo said. most storms i ride out, but for the first time in 15 years i'm thinking of not riding this one out. i think the storm will head right up the jersey shore at this point, he said. and locally, i don't think we're prepared. nobody's boarding up anything, and there could be some major devastation. stores even farther north in new hampshire were also gearing up for irene. the emergency display was up at the home depot in manchester, reported cnn affiliate wmur. generators. flashlights. backpack survival kits. and extra supplies of sump pumps. peter hoiries, who works for a restoration company, warned residents of irene's strong winds. standard shingles used in the new england area are good only for 75 miles per hour, he said. older ones could blow off in even lighter winds. in horseneck beach, massachusetts, the sun beat down thursday. no sign of irene yet, but people asked: what if? boat owners in falmouth harbor began removing their vessels, according to cnn affiliate whdh. some people find it exciting, the prospect of a hurricane -- generally thought of as a southern thing -- heading to new england. but veterans were quick to say beware. they're exciting until they get a week into not having hot water, refrigerator, running around for ice and no electric power, said bruce crenshaw, a charter boat captain. the excitement wears off quick. the reality is that many folks on the east coast were still in a wait-and-see mode thursday, as irene -- slowly but surely -- made her way toward them. cnn's phil gast contributed to this report.

" state-by-state developments related to hurricane irene by the cnn wire staff (cnn) -- here are storm-related developments in states affected by hurricane irene: south carolina no evacuations were ordered, as the storm path appears to be too far east to present serious problems. however, state emergency officials were monitoring irene and have contingency plans in place. the state emergency management agency is using its website, twitter, facebook and youtube to keep the public informed. north carolina gov. bev perdue declared a state of emergency for counties east of interstate 95. hurricane irene poses a significant threat to our state, perdue said, and we need to take appropriate action to ensure the safety of our residents and visitors, along with property and infrastructure along our coast. the latest hurricane center advisory projects irene will make landfall late saturday afternoon near ocracoke island on the outer banks. tropical storm-force winds and rain are projected to begin late friday and could increase to hurricane-force winds later saturday. pamlico community college in grantsboro is expected to open at 1 p.m. friday as a shelter for those seeking refuge from the storm, according to the county government website. at that time, a voluntary evacuation order takes effect for the county, which borders the atlantic. pamlico county sheriff bill sawyer jr. told cnn he talked with many fishermen and others who have been pulling their boats from the water and taking other precautions, adding when they're concerned, it's something really to be concerned about. still, he expressed confidence that residents will make it through the storm, saying, i think people know what they're doing. a mandatory evacuation order was in effect for residents and visitors in hyde county, north carolina, which includes ocracoke island, reachable only by boat or private plane, on the outer banks. nearby dare county, which includes manteo, nags head, duck and historic kitty hawk, issued a mandatory evacuation order for tourists and residents. carteret county also issued a mandatory evacuation order for visitors in part of the county. on friday, there will be a mandatory evacuation for all residents of bogue banks, said county spokesman rodney cates. currituck county said all residents must leave by 8 a.m. friday. state and county emergency management agencies coordinated with the american red cross to open shelters for residents leaving the outer banks. shelters were open in nash and wilson counties for visitors and residents from hyde county. other shelters were on standby in halifax, northampton and onslow counties for other evacuees from the outer banks. north carolina emergency management offcials were posting updates on twitter, facebook and on the crime control and public safety website. virginia gov. bob mcdonnell declared a state of emergency in virginia on thursday morning. we are issuing this state of emergency today as

" (cnn) -- elmhurst college, a private liberal arts school in suburban chicago affiliated with the united church of christ, has become the first college in the country to ask an optional question about a student's sexual orientation and gender identity on an undergraduate admission form, according to the school and a gay rights advocacy group. would you consider yourself a member of the lgbt (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) community? the new application asks prospective enrollees. students can answer yes, no, or prefer not to say. that optional demographic question is among others about religious affiliation, language spoken at home and whether they have worked with a community-based organization, according to the college and the advocacy group. the sexual orientation question is designed to help the college advance diversity and connect prospective students with school resources such as scholarships and campus organizations. we took this step in an effort to better serve each of our students as a unique person, elmhurst president s. alan ray said in a news release thursday. it also allows us to live out our commitments to cultural diversity, social justice, mutual respect among all persons, and the dignity of every individual. these are among the core values of this institution. they provide the foundation for all of our academic, student and community programs, ray said. added gary rold, dean of admission, in the media release: all of the information that we glean from our admission applications is used to provide a wide variety of opportunities, services and programming that is appropriate to each individual student. shane windmeyer, executive director of campus pride, which calls itself the leading national nonprofit advocating safer learning environments for lgbt college students, praised elmhurst college. elmhurst college has really set the bar when it comes to college admissions and allowing lgbt students to be who they are and to be out, windmeyer said. as a result, they can take responsibility for setting a safe learning environment for all students. for the past five years, campus pride has been trying to get the optional question included in a standardized online college application now used by more than 400 u.s. universities, including ivy league schools, windmeyer said. but that effort by campus pride has been unsuccessful, windmeyer said. elmhurst college is among the remaining 2,100 public and private four-year institutions in the country that are not part of that nonprofit membership organization using the standardized online application, windmeyer said. located in elmhurst, illinois, the college is affiliated with the united church of christ, a protestant denomination that was the first to ordain a woman in the 19th century. it was also the first to ordain an openly gay person in the 20th century: william r. johnson, a graduate of elmhurst college, who became a church minister in 1972, according to the school. the school describes itself as being at times pioneering on social justice issues, according to its news release. of course, we recognize that this question may signal to applicants that elmhurst is 'walking the walk' of support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons, ray said in the release. this is a source of pride for us. it is entirely consistent with our mission and vision to prepare students to understand and respect the diversity of the world's cultures and peoples.

" a hand opened the small slit in the door where his food was passed through. he heard someone angrily shouting and pointing at verses in an open quran pushed through the door. not long after, someone hammered off the lock on the door. at first he thought it was a trap, he told his mother by phone, maybe a ruse to get him in greater danger. but then the realization dawned: he had a chance to escape. i saw some other prisoners and they were cheering and pointing down the hall, said an exhausted vandyke. i knew i was free, but didn't know what to do or what was going on. vandyke had no possessions to gather up, only a wet and ragged prison uniform. he found a pair of sandals left behind by another fleeing prisoner and then escaped the prison along with hundreds of other inmates. many of those held in the facility were political prisoners, or had been caught up in crackdowns on rebel sympathizers or on the many battlefields edging closer to the capital. vandyke joined up with one small group walking through the abu salim neighborhood of tripoli, not knowing that they were in one of the last areas still controlled by gadhafi loyalists. they could hear explosions and gunfire, but also got news that rebels were taking control of the city. the group made their way to a mosque. there, the imam and other neighborhood leaders were handing out cash, trying to help people desperately short of supplies amid the chaos and electrical blackout in the area. vandyke said he moved on, to a makeshift hospital where he got some help and directions to a local wealthy person who had access to a working phone. it was there he was able to make his first phone call back to his worried girlfriend, lauren fischer, and mother, sharon vandyke, back in baltimore. i've always known he was ok, sharon vandyke told cnn late wednesday. the retired schoolteacher described the relief and surprise she felt after watching cnn endlessly for days, hoping for news and praying for her son's safety. now she and fischer are focused on getting him out of libya. vandyke said he was eventually able to hook up with another escaped inmate who had ties to rebel forces and could speak english. the man gained access to a car and two guards armed with ak-47 assault rifles, and they sped through the night past rebel checkpoints. eventually he arrived at a house once occupied by an american expatriate couple who had hastily fled in the earliest days of the conflict. vandyke said the home still had food on the counters, remnants from the last-second escape of the last people there, a welcome windfall for him after months of rancid prison food. and the working phone there was a lifeline to the outside, he added. the writer is one of at least four american civilians who have been freed from libyan prisons, the u.s. government said wednesday. we can confirm that all u.s. citizens who were known to be detained in libya have been released, u.s. state department spokesperson victoria nuland said in a prepared statement: the families of those detained individuals have been notified of their freedom and welfare. we remain concerned about the welfare and safety of those u.s. citizens who remain in tripoli. for safety and privacy reasons we are unable to provide additional details. vandyke was surprised to hear that other americans had been held in the prison and was unaware of their escape or current situations. having traveled to nearly a dozen middle eastern and african countries since 2007, vandyke left for benghazi in late february. friends there had told him what was happening in libya during the early stages of the revolution. he had a great respect for the people and the country, not the politics, his mother said. vandyke's loved ones aren't certain why he was arrested, although he had a u.s. passport and press credentials when he was seized on a day trip to brega. by phone, the exhausted writer said he would have a fuller account to tell of his capture after he was able to sleep and recuperate, but he said his arrest had been a surprise and he did not know the reason for it. vandyke had been confined in two prisons, including abu salim, from which he and the hundreds of others escaped wednesday, one day after rebels seized gadhafi's compound in the city. libyan officials had recently acknowledged vandyke was in custody. his mother traveled to turkey in may to seek assistance in his release, but the country had just closed its embassy in tripoli. his family, which has been assisted by the state department and u.s. rep. c.a. dutch ruppersberger of maryland, hopes to see vandyke in several days. he said he was in good physical health, said his mother. he was sorry we did not know for sure he was ok. sharon vandyke said her son was unaware that al qaeda leader osama bin laden had been killed by u.s. commandos in may. she and fischer, 28, expect vandyke, who first went to libya in 2008, to complete a book about the people he has met and places he has seen in mauritania, iraq, turkey, afghanistan, egypt and other countries. he toured several of those nations by motorcycle. despite everything, i have no problems with libyans, vandyke said, describing his safety and plans in tripoli. but i'll be determined to stay here to see the end of gadhafi.

" lifeguard sues new york over revealing swimsuit rule by katie silver , cnn story highlights roy lester says speedos are not appropriate for a 61-year-old he says a rule requiring suits like that amounts to age discrimination new york state says it does not discriminate based on age new york (cnn) -- a lifeguard is suing new york state parks for age-discrimination after a rule was put in placed that would have forced him to don swimwear he considered not appropriate for a 61-year-old. roy lester, 61, was a lifeguard at jones beach, long island for almost forty years until 2007 when the state instituted a new clothing requirement he considered discriminatory. the rule, still in operation, requires that to be re-hired as a lifeguard, participants must wear either boxers, briefs or board shorts when completing a qualifying swim test, according to new york state park documents. lester who believes that as you age you should show less skin prefers jammers; tight lycra shorts that end a couple of inches above the knee. the bankruptcy attorney claims speedos are not appropriate for a 61-year-old and refused to wear loose-fitting shorts because they would slow him down. when the jones beach lifeguard coordinators refused to let lester compete in his jammers, he saw it as the state trying to get rid of the older lifeguards. deeming this a blatant act of discrimination, he sued new york state parks in may 2007. the case was dismissed and, after appeal, it was dismissed again the following year in nassau county supreme court. the court found that since 80 of the 271 lifeguards hired in 2007 ranged from 40 to 80 years old -- six with the same age as lester -- there was no probable cause of age-based discrimination, according to court documents. however, the court reversed this decision last tuesday on second appeal allowing the case to go to trial. lester said the rule applies only to long island -- a municipality he claims has a unique disproportionate number of older lifeguards working there. it does not exist in any other municipality in the nation nor anywhere else in the world, he said. new york state parks refused to comment on the case because it is in litigation we do not discriminate based on age, is all spokesman peter brancato would say. both the attorney general for new york and the jones beach lifeguard coordinators office refused to comment. - "
" the code of conduct that had been used to bring the allegations against fairchild has been repealed. it became a campaign issue, and the new council said it wasn't needed, that existing laws and common sense were enough. morris workman lost his job at the mesquite local news; he had been under contract since selling the paper in 2009 and the contract was not renewed. a new editor took over and the site seems less newsy, with more items about community car washes and the like. after a flurry of where's morris? questions, reader comments have all but stopped. shively, who describes workman as a cancer on this town, said the reporter has the fairchilds' blood on his hands. workman shrugs off the criticism. he knows his website was not popular at city hall, which blames the political turmoil on people posting anonymous comments on the site. we get blamed for being mean, workman said. what we're guilty of is trying to get to the truth. but workman's psyche is not untouched by the turn of events. he is still blogging and working on other projects and said he's now more aware of the impact his stories have on people. it colors the way i look at things, he said. will something i do lead to a call the next morning that they have taken themselves out? the fairchild story drew comments on the website even after their deaths. posted one reader: it all seems so petty now. the tragedy came at a time when people around the country were noting the decline of civility in public discourse. the issue was on many minds in the aftermath of the january 8 assassination attempt on arizona rep. gabrielle giffords. donna fairchild's reasons for killing her husband and herself will forever remain a mystery. did she carry baggage that left her deeply disappointed in herself and ashamed of letting others down? was there something unique about mesquite's insular politics and the pressures she faced there? or could it have happened anywhere? christi kindel believes fairchild felt backed into a corner by a mean-spirited, small-town spat that unearthed other, deeply buried traumas and insecurities. suicide is the only way it ever was going to stop, she said. that's what i believe was in donna's mind. i cry for her every day. the people of mesquite have raised their voices in favor of open, civil public discourse. the mesquite that witnessed the fairchild tragedy was not the city of their dreams, they said at council meetings, candidate forums and in the mesquite local news. resident yoli bell suggested in a signed letter to the editor that the fairchilds might still be alive if the controversy had been handled with more compassion. was it necessary to plaster donna's picture with headlines to shame her like a criminal, and then accuse her like she was the first and only person who had ever done this? bell asked. i never saw anything like this done to another person until now. i just feel the dirty politics and cruel people were the last straw that broke her.

witnesses reported a number of buildings were evacuated as far away as north carolina and new york, where a 5.8 earthquake struck in 1944. the quake, which was recorded at 1:51 p.m., was shallow -- just 3.7 miles deep -- and located 88 miles southwest of washington near the town of mineral, virginia. the magnitude was initially reported as 5.8, then revised to 5.9, and then revised again back to 5.8. with so many on the east coast unaccustomed to earthquakes, many people were left wondering whether all that rumbling could have been caused by a truck, helicopter, an explosion or some other force. kate duddy was in an office building elevator in manhattan, alone, when the shaking started. i have never felt a quake before. it was scary having no idea what the cause was, she said. i felt the vibrations and the elevator stopped for a period of about five minutes. the earthquake triggered the automatic shutdown of a nuclear power plant less than 20 miles from the epicenter after it lost electricity. the quake signaled unusual events at 12 other nuclear facilities across the east coast and michigan, u.s. authorities reported. dominion virginia power said both reactors at its north anna plant shut down after the first tremors. reidelbach said the plant vented steam, but there was no release of radioactive material. dan stoddard, senior vice president of nuclear operations for dominion, said there was no damage to the spent fuel pool. officials were restoring full power to the site, which was operating on diesel generators. stoddard said that might happen by late tuesday, but that was before the evening aftershock. the nuclear regulatory commission was monitoring the plant. relatively minor damage was reported in a few virginia counties, including louisa, nearest to the epicenter. several school buildings had damage, as did town hall buildings, louisa county spokeswoman amanda reidelbach told cnn. an unspecified number of minor injuries were reported in the county. desi fleming, a resident of mineral in louisa county, said the quake arrived with a rumbling that sounded like a train coming to a stop. it knocked down two chimneys on the converted 1900-vintage home that now houses her parcel-shipping business. tuesday's incident occurred in a known seismic zone in central virginia, said dave russ of the u.s. geological survey. but the strength of the earthquake was a bit surprising. a 5.9 event occurred in 1897 near blacksburg, he said. at washington's national cathedral, spokesman richard weinberg said three 5- to 8-foot pinnacles had broken from the central tower. he said stone masons and engineers would assess the damage, which also included other pieces that broke and fell on the surrounding lawn. the building was evacuated and closed to the public. wayne clough, the secretary of the smithsonian institution, said the national museum's landmark castle on the mall had cracks in interior walls. there was no immediate indication of structural damage, but the 150-year-old building will need closer examination, he said. you want to do an inspection to be sure about that, clough said. clough, who's also an earthquake engineer, said the geography of the eastern seaboard helped transmit the shock from the carolinas to new england. the underlying bedrock is largely a solid sheet, so you get a lot more travel out of earthquake waves than you would in california, he said. those waves extended to downtown new york, where court buildings were evacuated. i was trying to figure out what was going on, like everyone else, said manhattan district attorney cyrus vance, who said he had been through many earthquakes when he lived in california. mayor michael bloomberg said at an afternoon news conference that the earthquake was felt across the five boroughs of the city, but there were no reports of injuries and virtually no reports of damage. the quake was also reported to have been felt on the island of martha's vineyard, where president barack obama was playing golf. he did not feel the earthquake, according to the white house. the earthquake slowed but didn't halt major transportation services. service at major airports throughout the region was disrupted, but all were reported to have resumed normal operations about 75 minutes after the earthquake struck. at john f. kennedy international airport and newark-liberty international airport, control towers were evacuated, the port authority of new york and new jersey said. amtrak on tuesday evening said service between washington and baltimore had returned to normal speeds following inspections. in spotsylvania, virginia, tish walker said she was spooked and staying outside for the moment. i used to live in california, so i know shaking and this felt big, she said. i grabbed my dog and raced outside; my first thought is always that the furnace might explode or a cabinet crashes down on top of us. cnn's vito maggiolo, chris lawrence,

" los angeles (cnn) -- rodney king, whose videotaped beating by police led to the 1992 los angeles riots, was charged wednesday with two misdemeanor counts of driving under the influence, authorities said. his alcohol content exceeded the legal limit and he was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs, riverside county sheriff spokeswoman courtney donowho said. on july 12, king was behind the wheel of a 1994 mitsubishi when he was pulled over in moreno valley, california, about 60 miles southeast of los angeles. prosecutors have up to 45 days to file charges on a dui arrest. according to the police report, a moreno valley traffic enforcement unit observed king commit several traffic violations, donowho said, although he was not cited for speeding. after questioning king, a patrol officer noticed king exhibiting signs of behavior that might involve alcohol or drug consumption, she said. king was asked to step out of the car and submit to a voluntary field sobriety test, said donowho, adding that king was cooperative and compliant. king was arrested and transported to the moreno valley police department for an evidentiary test to determine the type of substance. following his release from custody, king told cnn he was under the influence of a medical marijuana prescription but denied being under the influence of alcohol. i had marijuana in me that i take to deal with migraine headaches and pain in my lower extremities, although i should not have been driving, he said. king was unavailable for comment on the misdemeanor charges, according to his fiancee cynthia kelly. arraignment is scheduled for friday at riverside county superior court. king's 1991 beating by los angeles police officers after a traffic stop left him with skull fractures and brain and kidney damage. it was captured on video by a nearby resident, and four officers were indicted as a result. the following year, three officers were acquitted and a mistrial was declared in a fourth officer. those verdicts in a predominantly white suburb of simi valley set off three days of riots in predominantly african-american neighborhoods. by the time it was over, 55 people were dead, more than 2,000 were hurt, and property damage exceeded $1 billion. two of the officers were later convicted of federal civil rights charges, and king won $3.8 million in damages from the city in a civil suit. king was on parole for robbery at the time of the beating and has had several run-ins with the law in the ensuing years. he served a 90-day jail term in 1996 for a hit-and-run involving his wife at the time, and pleaded guilty in 2004 to reckless driving and driving under the influence of a controlled substance. in march, he was cited for driving without a license after being pulled over in arcadia, california. earlier this year, in a cnn documentary, king spoke to cnn's don lemon about his struggle with alcohol abuse. i'll always have an issue when it comes to alcohol. my dad was an alcoholic, the addiction part is in my blood, king said. what i've learned to do is to arrest my -- addiction, arrest it myself, so i don't get arrested.
